"Movie producer Bradley Thomas filed for divorce & custody of kids before aristocrat wife fell from balcony, records show","Isabelle Thomas took her own life at 39, but mystery and heartbreak still surround her death","Emma Parry, Senior Reporter","12:16, 26 Oct 2024","12:56, 26 Oct 2024","News,US News","AN Oscar-nominated film producer was divorcing his wife at the time she plunged to her death from the upper floor of a Los Angeles hotel in January, The U.S. Sun has learned. Movie mogul Bradley Thomas, who was nominated for an Oscar for Killers of the Flower Moon, filed for divorce from English heiress Isabelle Thomas four months earlier in September 2023. On September 15, 2023, the 58-year-old, twice-married producer requested a divorce citing ""irreconcilable differences"" and asked for legal and physical custody of the couple's three-year-old twins, court papers reveal. Isabelle, who was 39, was told she had 30 days to file a response, and she was not allowed to take her children out of state, according to the documents. Isabelle did not attend a case review conference on December 13 at the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles. Court filings state that lawyers for Bradley requested ""additional time to serve Respondent and file Proof of Service of Summons"" at the hearing, and the case was placed on hold. Isabelle never filed a response. On January 29, she was found dead in the pool area of the Hotel Angeleno in Brentwood after falling from an upper-floor balcony. Los Angeles County Medical Examiners announced that Isabelle had ""multiple traumatic injuries"" and recorded the death as a suicide. The case is listed as closed, although the department states that the full report will not be available until it has been ""finalized."" It is understood that Isabelle did not leave a note. On February 1, three days after his wife's death, attorneys for Bradley filed a request to dismiss the divorce case without prejudice. Mystery and heartbreak still surround Isabelle's death. Although the court papers state that the couple separated on September 5, 2023, they were pictured together afterward, including at the BAFTA tea party on January 13, 2024. Writing after her death, Deadline reporter Mike Fleming Jr. also said he had just seen the couple at an Apple Golden Globes party. It's unclear whether the couple were trying to salvage the marriage at the time of her death. Bradley has been a successful producer since the 1990s as part of the team behind Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, and Me Myself & Irene Isabelle was the daughter of Henry Lawrence, 7th Baronet of Lucknow, and his ex-wife Penelope Nunan. Speaking at the time of her death, Lawrence told The Sun, ""I have absolutely no idea why this happened or what was troubling her. It is so awful. [...] I was last in contact with her a couple of weeks ago."" Isabelle's mother, Penelope, was equally distraught, telling The U.S. Sun at the time, ""This is the worst possible nightmare...my daughter is married to an American who is in the spotlight, and he is still trying to deal with it. It is a very sad event."" In a statement, Isabelle's family paid tribute to her as the ""light of our lives."" ""She was courageous and took all life’s opportunities without fear, showering love and kindness on her friends, family, and children along the way,"" they wrote. ""Her projects were as diverse as her passions, reflecting a curiosity about people and our culture that inspired everyone lucky enough to spend time with her."" ""We remember her as a soul mate, beautiful daughter, sister, devoted mother and wife."" Isabelle was born in Bath, England, in 1984 and was privately educated before graduating from Oxford University with a degree in biological sciences. After graduating, Isabelle advised former British Prime Minister David Cameron on his Tech City start-up initiative. She was also a DJ and socialite who was friends with celebrities such as singer Amy Winehouse and actress Jameela Jamil. Isabelle later moved to Los Angeles to pursue film-making, eventually producing a documentary on kindness and another about pickleball, per Deadline. She married Bradley in 2018, and they had two children, Poppy and Grace, who were born in 2020. Isabelle was also the stepmother to Bradley's two older children. The U.S. Sun has reached out to Bradley's attorneys for comment on the divorce filing.

"Meghan Markle dumped the Royal Family, dumped her friends – & Prince Harry could be next for the CHOP, royal expert says",Watch our exclusive chat with Hugo Vickers in the video player above,"Summer Raemason, News ReporterSummer Raemason, News Reporter","13:13, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","13:13, 26 Oct 2024",Royals,"MEGHAN Markle dumped the Royal Family and her friends - and Prince Harry could be next for the chop, a royal expert has claimed. The Duchess of Sussex, 43, raised eyebrows earlier this month as she made two solo public appearances without Harry. Since getting married to Harry in 2018, Meghan has fallen out with a number of people including her family, her in-laws and her best friend Jessica Mulroney. There are also rumours of tension with tennis star Serena Williams, while Sophie Trudeau has reportedly ""distanced herself"" from Meg. It comes as royal experts have previously suggested Meghan and Harry are living ""increasingly live ""separate lives"". Now Hugo Vickers has spoken out about the future of the Duke and Duchess. The royal biographer and broadcaster revealed he is worried how Meghan's behaviour over the years was a pattern which could see Harry suffer. The 72-year-old exclusively told The Sun: ""People usually act in character, and they usually act on form. ""I hate to say it but her form is that she dumped her father, she dumped her first husband, she dumped her Canadian chef lover. ""She dumped Jessica Mulroney. She then dumped the dumped the entire British Royal family. ""So who is going to be next for the chop? I think inevitably, probably Prince Harry, and there'll come a time when she'll think that she doesn't need him."" Hugo added that although it hasn't happened yet, Harry will eventually be painted as the person ""in the wrong"". He said: ""I don't know when she might make that particular call and it's not for me to speculate, but you know she will probably somehow put him in the wrong, so that she can say that she's a wronged woman, and he's just behaved like all the others. ""I mean I don't think she ever admits that she is wrong about anything, but I feel very sorry for Prince Harry, because I think he's in a very difficult place at the moment. ""I think he has been for some time. I don't think that her projects have done Harry any good."" Hugo says that when the Duke has gone off on his own and got involved with initiatives close to his heart like the Invictus Games, he has been more successful. The royal biographer added: ""The Invictus games wasn't entirely his initiative, but he certainly was the one who made it famous and popular, and he's done an incredibly good job with it. ""What's strange about that is that the message, as far as I can read of Invictus, is, you are not a victim, you are able to get on with life, and are able to make wonderful contributions, and he gets people going again. ""And yet what has he done to himself, or what's he allowed to happen to himself? ""He's turned himself into a victim, I mean, he's always complaining about everything and how everybody's against him, and you know there's interviews; Oprah, Winfrey Netflix, the book Spare. ""It's all a litany of 'poor little me' complaints, which is terrible."" Hugo believes that if Meghan had not come along it ""wouldn't have happened"" but also concedes Harry was complicit in it. He added: ""My reading of it is, she detected that he was uncomfortable about certain things, and in a way he she exploited that and fed on it to the point that he definitely went willingly."" It comes as Tina Brown claimed in a podcast that Harry was being led like a “lamb to the slaughter” who ""follows Meghan Markle like a child"". During the chat, Tina also criticised Meghan’s judgement, and said: “She has all these people, asks them their opinion, and then doesn’t follow it”. Tina has not held back talking about the Sussexes over the years, famously describing the couple’s ""Megxit"" and leaving the royal family as a “disaster”. It comes as a source close to the couple said a “twin-track approach is evolving” in response to their alleged “professional separation”. By Jon Rogers and Summer Raemason MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry are 'going their own ways' as they increasingly live 'separate lives', royal experts told The Sun. Speaking on our first ever Royal Exclusive Live show, Arthur Edwards and Jennie Bond lifted the lid on the power couple's recent time apart. Sun legend Arthur revealed how the pair are 'doing things separately now' after failing to be spotted together in three weeks. Meanwhile Ms Bond, a royal correspondent for the last 35 years, also revealed: ""Meghan is not popular. She doesn't want to come back and they are going their own ways, to some extent"". The pair spoke on our first Royal Exclusive Live show, which you can watch on our YouTube channel. The event was hosted on Friday night in front of a live audience of more than 100 special guests. Mr Edwards said: “I don’t think she [Meghan] can come here much. “I don’t think people think too much of her. “I think she’s struggling in popularity in the UK and I think they seem to be doing things separately now. She’s got her programme and he’s got his. Mr Edwards added: “He comes into Britain now with no fuss. “He’s come for the Invictus Games, in and out with no fuss, he came for his uncle’s funeral, no fuss."" Royal commentator Jennie Bond said: “The point is he doesn’t want to come back [into the Royal Family in the UK], I think. “He regarded it as a trap. He still thinks his father and his brother are trapped and he’s finding his own way. “All credit to him. “I think Meghan has her own independent style and way of life. “Yes, it’s not in tune with the people in the UK. “She’s not popular and I don’t think she wants to come back and therefore they are going their own ways, to an extent. “But I hope and believe that Harry is very happy in his life."" Prince Harry is said to have had a “three-week break”, which included a solo trip to Lesotho in Africa in honour of his charity, Sentebale. Harry also attended a string of events in New York unaccompanied by his wife, and also did a surprise TV stint and tour of a haunted maze on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. It follows the revelations that Harry celebrated the night of his milestone 40th birthday without Meghan in September. The duke went on a hiking trip with pals to celebrate his big day, leaving his wife and their kids at home.  Sources close to the couple insist it was Meghan who organised the lads’ trip. However, a Sussex confidante addressed rumours, insisting: “It is normal for couples to not do everything together.” By Summer Raemason “MOANING” Meghan Markle has “upset everybody and lost almost all her allies including me,” a royal expert has said. Broadcaster and royal biographer Hugo Vickers, 72, has taken a swipe at the Duchess of Sussex, 43, adding that it “can’t be a coincidence” that the royal has managed to lose so many supporters. In particular, Mr Vickers singled out the former Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown as someone Meghan had upset. Ms Brown took part in an episode of The Ankler podcast where she took aim at the Duchess, saying Meghan had “the worst judgement of anyone in the entire world” and that Megxit had been “a disaster”. Mr Vickers told The Sun Online: ""Megan does seem to have a capacity for losing friends and allies all around the place and Tina Brown, of course, is a very intelligent observer of the scene, and she's been doing it for a very long time. ""For what it's worth, Meghan lost me as an ally, too, because when she first joined the Royal Family, the line I was taking was she's the first member to have addressed the United Nations. ""There was so much that she could do, but she gradually managed to upset everybody, including Tina Brown, and that can't be a coincidence.” He also explained how he had “lost confidence” in the former Suits actress with the birth of her son Archie. Mr Vickers said: ""The way I lost confidence when there was all that ridiculous nonsense about when Archie was born, and she wouldn't tell us. ""She was the first woman I've ever heard of who's given birth and subsequently gone into labour later on. ""That doesn't normally seem to happen, that seems to be rather strange, and then she wouldn't tell us who the godparents were, and all these small things, you know, are really tiresome.” Mr Vickers also revealed that while Meghan’s profile was given an enormous boost by marrying Prince Harry he thought she “wasn’t particularly committed” to being part of the Royal Family. He said: ""It does seem to me that she wasn't particularly committed to being a member of the Royal Family. ""By marrying Prince Harry, her profile went up globally, enormously, and so people wanted to hear more about her, and to some extent more from her. “There was some quite worrying things quite early on when the four of them were on the platform together and she was saying, 'we've got to hit the road running'. “In other words let's get on with me using my new role to promote what I'm interested in.” He added: ""I think she probably misunderstood quite a lot of things to be quite honest about what it meant to be a member of the Royal Family, which is a life of complete service and devotion. ""They work extremely hard, but they're working for us, not for themselves.” Mr Vickers believes that Meghan quickly realised her status was that of being Harry’s wife and she wanted to capitalise on that but it wasn’t going that well. Mr Vickers added: ""I never thought she would stay forever to be honest. “But I didn't think that she would go with Prince Harry while the Queen was alive, because actually that caused the Queen an enormous amount of distress and anxiety at the end of her life. ""I don't think she has good judgement. “I think she had a plan, and now it may take a little while longer for us to know whether her eventual plan works out for her.”"

Iran vows revenge for Israel’s ‘Day of Repentance’ blitz as Hamas warns strike is ‘escalation’ amid fears of all-out-war,Watch the IDF confirm the 'precise strikes on military targets in Iran' in the clip above,Annabel BateEllie DoughtyAnnabel BateEllie Doughty,"0:27, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","15:30, 26 Oct 2024","News,World News","IRAN has vowed to seek revenge on Israel after it launched three waves of airstrikes into the country overnight - following a series of attacks from Tehran over the past year. Dubbing it a violation of international law, Iran said it is ""entitled and obligated to defend itself against external aggressive acts"". Israel's military operation - dubbed ""Days of Repentance"" - came as the war-torn region has been bracing for an Israeli response to Iran's drone attack on October 1. Hamas - Iran's terror puppet group based in Gaza - slammed the Israeli strikes as an ""escalation"", calling it a ""violation of Iran's sovereignty"". Meanwhile Iran's most powerful proxy Hezbollah, operating out of Lebanon, said today that it launched a drone attack against Israel's Tel Nof airbase, south of Tel Aviv, in response to last night's attack. It also claimed to have targeted an intelligence base in the northern city of Safed with a rocket barrage. Israel has not verified the group's claims. Iranian military sources have said four soldiers were killed in the overnight attack with the figure ""expected to rise further"", state news agency Tasnim News reports. It also said others left wounded are in ""critical"" condition. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) announced on Saturday that their revenge blitz against Iranian military bases had finished, and warned that any response from Iran would force them to ""pay a heavy price"". IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel was ""conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran"" in response to ""relentless"" attacks by Iran and its proxies since October 7. He added: ""If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond. ""Our message is clear: All those who threaten the State of Israel and seek to drag the region into a wider escalation will pay a heavy price."" Iranian state TV confirmed on Saturday that several strong explosions were heard around the capital and in the more remote rural regions, beginning at around 2am local time. Two Israeli officials told The New York Times that some 20 different sites were hit in the overnight attack. The first wave of attacks focused on Iranian air defence systems, with the second and third targeting missile and drone bases and production sites, Israeli and American officials told Axios. Israel reportedly sent a message of warning to Iran on Friday ahead of the retaliatory airstrikes - warning them not to respond, Axios reports. Sources said it was an attempt to limit the possibility of a wider regional conflict after the strikes. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, speaking from Samoa, said he is monitoring the situation in the Middle East ""closely"". He urged ""restraint"" from both sides, adding: ""Iran should not respond."" ""We will continue to work with allies to de-escalate the situation across the region,"" he said. Witnesses in Tehran confirmed hearing loud explosions during the early morning blitz. ""It was so loud and the sky became red,"" said an Iranian resident in Tehran, who asked not to be named, Middle East Monitor reports. Iranian authorities revealed that at an attack on one of their police convoys in the southern region of Sistan and Baluchestan killed at least 10 officers on Saturday. Authorities identified no immediate suspects for the attack, and no group has claimed responsibility. Last night's blitz marked the first time Iran has been hit by a foreign air force since its war with Iraq in the 1980s. The White House was warned shortly before the strikes began but the US was not involved, according to reports. Israel in recent weeks had been planning a response to a ballistic-missile attack by Iran on October 1, Tehran's second direct attack on Israel in six months. The first came on April 1 - with the IDF saying ""99 per cent"" of Iran's missiles were shot down or destroyed. Tehran launched an unprecedented blitz in October - aiming at least 180 ballistic missiles into Israeli territory. It caused only minimal damage and a few injuries. Iran said the barrage was in retaliation for attacks in recent months that killed leaders of Hezbollah, Hamas and the Iranian military - including Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah leader. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately said Iran had made a big mistake. Before the October attack, Israel had landed a series of devastating blows against Hezbollah, which has been firing rockets into Israel near-daily for over a year ever since the deadly Hamas attack against Israel that sparked the war in Gaza. A few days ago secret plans showing Israel's preparation for a potential revenge strike on Iran were leaked, US officials said. The alleged documents, marked as ""top secret"", were said to contain US intelligence analysing Israel's inevitable retaliation plan against Iran. They reportedly contained satellite imagery appearing to show Israel's preparation of munitions and military drills, the New York Times reports. Other reports said the Israeli Air Force was prepping long-range ballistic and air-to-surface missiles - believed to be for a potential strike against Iran. The documents also suggest Israel was conducting covert surveillance on Iran using advanced drone technology. The Sun is not directly quoting or showing the information from the leaked documents. Israel launched a ground operation into Lebanon earlier this month to attack Hezbollah and push the terror group away from the border to allow displaced Israelis to return. This has stoked existing tensions in the region with more than 1,900 people in Lebanon killed in the five weeks since Israel invaded. Israeli authorities have said 59 people have been killed in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights. The Israeli military has issued evacuation warnings for civilians in Beirut - where many fierce strikes have been concentrated. IDF Col. Avichay Adraee said during one such warning: ""You are in the vicinity of Hezbollah facilities, which the IDF will operate against in the near future."" Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon - both Iran-backed militant groups. The IDF have been striking parts of northern Gaza, claiming they are aiming to wipe out Hamas brutes. But the strikes have also killed scores of Palestinians who have been unable to flee the densely populated area. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war so far, according to Gaza-run health centres.  The figure also includes Hamas terrorists, but Israel has not specified the exact ratio of civilian to militant. Hamas killed around 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals in the October 7 attack last year, and kidnapped around 250 more into Gaza."
Iran vows revenge for Israel’s ‘Day of Repentance’ blitz as Hamas warns strike is ‘escalation’ amid fears of all-out-war,Watch the IDF confirm the 'precise strikes on military targets in Iran' in the clip above,Annabel BateEllie DoughtyAnnabel BateEllie Doughty,"0:27, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","15:30, 26 Oct 2024","News,World News","IRAN has vowed to seek revenge on Israel after it launched three waves of airstrikes into the country overnight - following a series of attacks from Tehran over the past year. Dubbing it a violation of international law, Iran said it is ""entitled and obligated to defend itself against external aggressive acts"". Israel's military operation - dubbed ""Days of Repentance"" - came as the war-torn region has been bracing for an Israeli response to Iran's drone attack on October 1. Hamas - Iran's terror puppet group based in Gaza - slammed the Israeli strikes as an ""escalation"", calling it a ""violation of Iran's sovereignty"". Meanwhile Iran's most powerful proxy Hezbollah, operating out of Lebanon, said today that it launched a drone attack against Israel's Tel Nof airbase, south of Tel Aviv, in response to last night's attack. It also claimed to have targeted an intelligence base in the northern city of Safed with a rocket barrage. Israel has not verified the group's claims. Iranian military sources have said four soldiers were killed in the overnight attack with the figure ""expected to rise further"", state news agency Tasnim News reports. It also said others left wounded are in ""critical"" condition. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) announced on Saturday that their revenge blitz against Iranian military bases had finished, and warned that any response from Iran would force them to ""pay a heavy price"". IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel was ""conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran"" in response to ""relentless"" attacks by Iran and its proxies since October 7. He added: ""If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond. ""Our message is clear: All those who threaten the State of Israel and seek to drag the region into a wider escalation will pay a heavy price."" Iranian state TV confirmed on Saturday that several strong explosions were heard around the capital and in the more remote rural regions, beginning at around 2am local time. Two Israeli officials told The New York Times that some 20 different sites were hit in the overnight attack. The first wave of attacks focused on Iranian air defence systems, with the second and third targeting missile and drone bases and production sites, Israeli and American officials told Axios. Israel reportedly sent a message of warning to Iran on Friday ahead of the retaliatory airstrikes - warning them not to respond, Axios reports. Sources said it was an attempt to limit the possibility of a wider regional conflict after the strikes. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, speaking from Samoa, said he is monitoring the situation in the Middle East ""closely"". He urged ""restraint"" from both sides, adding: ""Iran should not respond."" ""We will continue to work with allies to de-escalate the situation across the region,"" he said. Witnesses in Tehran confirmed hearing loud explosions during the early morning blitz. ""It was so loud and the sky became red,"" said an Iranian resident in Tehran, who asked not to be named, Middle East Monitor reports. Iranian authorities revealed that at an attack on one of their police convoys in the southern region of Sistan and Baluchestan killed at least 10 officers on Saturday. Authorities identified no immediate suspects for the attack, and no group has claimed responsibility. Last night's blitz marked the first time Iran has been hit by a foreign air force since its war with Iraq in the 1980s. The White House was warned shortly before the strikes began but the US was not involved, according to reports. Israel in recent weeks had been planning a response to a ballistic-missile attack by Iran on October 1, Tehran's second direct attack on Israel in six months. The first came on April 1 - with the IDF saying ""99 per cent"" of Iran's missiles were shot down or destroyed. Tehran launched an unprecedented blitz in October - aiming at least 180 ballistic missiles into Israeli territory. It caused only minimal damage and a few injuries. Iran said the barrage was in retaliation for attacks in recent months that killed leaders of Hezbollah, Hamas and the Iranian military - including Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah leader. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately said Iran had made a big mistake. Before the October attack, Israel had landed a series of devastating blows against Hezbollah, which has been firing rockets into Israel near-daily for over a year ever since the deadly Hamas attack against Israel that sparked the war in Gaza. A few days ago secret plans showing Israel's preparation for a potential revenge strike on Iran were leaked, US officials said. The alleged documents, marked as ""top secret"", were said to contain US intelligence analysing Israel's inevitable retaliation plan against Iran. They reportedly contained satellite imagery appearing to show Israel's preparation of munitions and military drills, the New York Times reports. Other reports said the Israeli Air Force was prepping long-range ballistic and air-to-surface missiles - believed to be for a potential strike against Iran. The documents also suggest Israel was conducting covert surveillance on Iran using advanced drone technology. The Sun is not directly quoting or showing the information from the leaked documents. Israel launched a ground operation into Lebanon earlier this month to attack Hezbollah and push the terror group away from the border to allow displaced Israelis to return. This has stoked existing tensions in the region with more than 1,900 people in Lebanon killed in the five weeks since Israel invaded. Israeli authorities have said 59 people have been killed in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights. The Israeli military has issued evacuation warnings for civilians in Beirut - where many fierce strikes have been concentrated. IDF Col. Avichay Adraee said during one such warning: ""You are in the vicinity of Hezbollah facilities, which the IDF will operate against in the near future."" Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon - both Iran-backed militant groups.

The two-year-old tot was terrifyingly knifed in the frenzied attack in East London on Friday evening. A woman in her 30s and an eight-year-old girl were also seriously injured in the horror on residential street First Avenue in Dagenham. A hero neighbour has now described the moment he burst inside a house to save the boy. Davey Holland, 40, forced entry into the property after getting a knock at the door by the blood-soaked mother. The dad-of-six told The Sun: “The mum knocked at my door. It was horrible. “She was saying there’s a baby in the house, please help him.” Davey smashed open a window - passing by the suspect who was being treated by an off-duty police officer. A man, in his 40s, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. The three victims, who are believed to be known to each other, were attacked at around 5.35pm. They were rushed to a major trauma centre to receive urgent treatment for stab injuries. Police had previously said the injuries of the woman, in her 30s, and the boy were life threatening. And that both the injured children were girls. The arrested man - detained at the scene - was transported to hospital after being ""taken unwell"". He has now been discharged into police custody. Mick Aransibia, 63, a builder who lives on the street, told The Sun: ""I came out and the whole street was lit up with blue lights. ""There was a good 12 units here in just police alone."" Another witness told us: ""About 5.30pm I heard shouting - I looked out of the window and I saw a lady covered in blood. ""She was very distraught, she was with a little girl. ""It’s shocking - it’s not something that happens in this area. ""Kids literally play outside in the street, that’s how safe it is. I look at it as a personal tragedy - but it’s so sad.” Another person said: ""My little nephew was playing out and he ran in saying he could see blood everywhere. ""When I came out, there was a woman running down the street with a girl. ""It didn’t seem real - I just phoned the ambulance straight away. I feel like I’m still in shock."" One witness explained that his young nephew was playing on the road when the attack took place, prompting him to find the injured victims and call an ambulance. He told The Sun: ""My nephew was playing outside and he came running in the house saying “someone’s bleeding, someone’s bleeding."" Referring to the man arrested, he added: ""He came out of the house and locked the door so no one could get in.. The police arrived pretty quickly, and he was arrested outside."" Aerial images showed a huge emergency services response, including more than eight police cars and an air ambulance. A crime scene remained in place last night, the Met said.

You might imagine this was all very scary but honestly, it wasn’t. The doctors were skilled professionals and they had all the tools they’d need, so during the procedure I was so relaxed that at one point, I nodded off. I felt like a car. My fuel lines had become all clogged up and they were mending them. Easy. Sure, they said there was a five per cent chance that my heart would stop but there’s a five per cent chance I’ll be eaten by a lion this afternoon and I’m not worried about that. What is scary though is what came ­afterwards. The advice on how I must live my life from now on. Literally, I am not allowed to have fun any more. I must live in a ­Liberal ­Democrat, holier-than-thou fog of weeds, seeds and yoga. This is terrifying. And if I go to a party, I must stand in a corner, nursing some refreshing elderflower juice, before going home at about 9.30. That’s ­terrifying too. Then there’s my work, which I love. I like it so much in fact, I currently have ten jobs. I honestly make Elon Musk look like a slacker. I write three newspaper columns a week, I have a brewery, a pub, a shop, I host Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?, run a farm, make a television show about that and this week, my latest book came out. “Yes well, a lot of that will have to go” said the doctor. “And what would I replace it with? “Golf’s good”, he ­suggested. No, it isn’t. What do people do when they stop work? It wouldn’t be so bad if I had a hobby but I’ve always thought that hobbies are for people who were caught playing with themselves by their mothers when they were younger. “Stop doing that and get a hobby.” Have you ever tried kale? Well, don’t, because it’s like eating the contents of a AAA battery I wasn’t, and that’s why I don’t make Airfix models or play the piano. Which means that if I didn’t work, I’d just sit at home all day, rotting. The worst problem though is diet. To cut my alarmingly high levels of cholesterol, I need to cut out, completely, ­everything I like eating. Bacon, sausages, beef, lamb, pork, butter, chips, proper milk, Cadbury’s fruit and nut bars and the interesting bit in an egg. I’ve had a week now to live in the new regime and it’s horrific. Have you ever tried kale? Well, don’t, because it’s like eating the contents of a AAA battery. And then there’s Greek yoghurt. What’s that all about? I’ve suspected for some time that yoghurt is made from the cheese found in a homeless person’s ­genitals, and now I know this is so. It’s disgusting. But it’s not as bad as almond milk. Which a) isn’t milk and b) tastes like ­liquefied marzipan. Which is the only foodstuff worse than Greek yoghurt. Booze? Technically, this isn’t necessarily high in cholesterol, but it does make you fat so that has to go too. All of it. So, I own a brewery and pub and at the shop, a butcher’s counter. Yum yum. Except now, I can no longer get high on my own supply. Instead I have to buy my “food” from some kind of wholefood store that sells nothing but South African nuclear-free peace beans. We must now move on to the question of exercise. I’ve always seen this is something you do when travelling from the car to the pub, or from the lunch table to the sitting room. But apparently, when I’ve rec­overed from the operation, I must do more. I must even go on the sort of “walk” where I end up back where I started. What’s the point of that? And I must pick things up with the sole aim of putting them down again. I’m also encouraged to sit up, using nothing but my stomach muscles. And why? So I can lie down then repeat the process, over and over again until I’m exhausted. Of course, you may well argue that I had it coming, that the wonkiness of my arteries is all my fault and that I shouldn’t moan. And you do have a point. The problem is that I see the gift of life as being about the same as the gift of, let’s say, a million pounds. Some people would invest this money and live carefully and parsimoniously on the interest. I wouldn’t, and indeed I didn’t. I ­grabbed the gift by the scruff of its neck and went berserk. I wanted to see every country in the world, and have a Ferrari and always be the last to leave a party and never say no to anything that sounded exciting. Not many people have dropped a laser-guided bomb from an F-15 fighter bomber. But I have. I lived in a blizzard of hangovers and jet lag for 30 years. Smoking? Yup. Started at 14 and became a world champion, sucking down sixty Marlboro Reds a day. Drink? Big time. When doctors asked how much I was putting away each day, I’d tell them straight. “Three or four pints.” They’d be reasonably happy with that, till I added: “Of wine.” I always knew this lifestyle wasn’t going to cause me to live to 112, and I didn’t really care. Because why deny yourself all that fun in your thirties and forties and even ­fifties just so you can have as long as possible with a grey face and a tube up your nose in an old people’s home? Here’s the thing, though. I’m now 64 and last week, when the Grim Reaper poked his nose round the door, I decided that actually, I quite fancied living a little bit longer. I want to see my grandchildren grow up. I saw the dawn this morning and it was magnificent, so I’d quite like to see a few more of those too. Also, I still want to visit the Galapagos Islands. To achieve all this, I must live on water and steamed fish, and exercise. But it’s going to be my eleventh job. Not dying. Of course, there will be those who say I should have started on this new career path earlier. They have a point, except for one thing. If you want to avoid spending the last few years of your life in a festival of boredom and denial, you must start the festival when you’re about 32. And I can’t see the point of that. Living a long life of misery to avoid a short bit of misery at the end. My recommendation then is to keep your foot hard down until you run out of fuel. And that’s when you buy the Tesla Lib Dem lifestyle.  When you no longer have a choice. In short, je ne regrette rien.

Strictly mystery as scandal-hit Wynne Evans and Katya Jones disappear from screens again,Eagle-eyed fans at home noticed how the pair were missing from the iconic 'Clauditorium',"Alex Doyle, TV ReporterAlex Doyle, TV Reporter","19:47, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","20:01, 26 Oct 2024","TV,News TV","WYNNE Evans and Katya Jones disappeared from screens during Strictly's Halloween special. The latest episode of the BBC series saw the pro dancers and their celeb partners dress up for the spooky occasion. At the start of the show hosts Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman introduced the couples as well as the judges. Wynne, 52, could be seen dressed as the devil with pro Katya also donning a matching outfit. However, the pair then disappeared for over 30 minutes, failing to appear on the raised platform with Claudia Winkleman and their fellow contestants. Eagle-eyed fans noticed at home, with one writing on social media: ""Where's Katya and Wyn?"" A second wrote: ""Is Wynne not allowed to be with Claudia and the other contestants at the top of the stairs? Have not seen him there all show."" ""Are they deliberately keeping Wynne & Katya away from the cameras,"" asked a third. Wynne and Katya did eventually appear for their Salsa, earning a total of 31 points, before vanishing once again. The BBC insisted Wynne was in the 'Clauditorium' when contacted by The Sun, despite fans not seeing him. At around 7:40pm they both then appeared in the back of a shot as Shayne Ward and Nancy Xu spoke to Claudia. It comes after the the Go Compare star also disappeared for a period last week. Earlier this month he was left 'devastated' after being embroiled in a 'TV grope' scandal. He could be seen with his hand around professional partner Katya Jones' waist during a live show. He later said it was ""a stupid joke that had gone wrong"". Wynne later said on BBC Radio: ""I'm absolutely heartbroken by the things that have been written about me in the last day.

The latest episode of the BBC series saw the pro dancers and their celeb partners dress up for the spooky occasion. At the start of the show hosts Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman introduced the couples as well as the judges. Wynne, 52, could be seen dressed as the devil with pro Katya also donning a matching outfit. However, the pair then disappeared for over 30 minutes, failing to appear on the raised platform with Claudia Winkleman and their fellow contestants. Eagle-eyed fans noticed at home, with one writing on social media: ""Where's Katya and Wyn?"" A second wrote: ""Is Wynne not allowed to be with Claudia and the other contestants at the top of the stairs? Have not seen him there all show."" ""Are they deliberately keeping Wynne & Katya away from the cameras,"" asked a third. Wynne and Katya did eventually appear for their Salsa, earning a total of 31 points, before vanishing once again. The BBC insisted Wynne was in the 'Clauditorium' when contacted by The Sun, despite fans not seeing him. At around 7:40pm they both then appeared in the back of a shot as Shayne Ward and Nancy Xu spoke to Claudia. It comes after the the Go Compare star also disappeared for a period last week. Earlier this month he was left 'devastated' after being embroiled in a 'TV grope' scandal. He could be seen with his hand around professional partner Katya Jones' waist during a live show. He later said it was ""a stupid joke that had gone wrong"". Wynne later said on BBC Radio: ""I'm absolutely heartbroken by the things that have been written about me in the last day. ""It's not nice to live in that time, but basically Katya and I are really, really close and we're really good friends, and on Saturday night we made a stupid joke. ""It was a stupid joke that went wrong, OK?  ""We thought it was funny. It wasn't funny. ""It was been totally misinterpreted."""
Keir Starmer denies he’s a ‘liar’ & promises ‘light at end of the tunnel’ as Brits brace for £35billion Budget tax bomb,Sir Keir has said the pain will be worth it,Ryan Sabey in SamoaRyan MerrifieldRyan Sabey in SamoaRyan Merrifield,"10:42, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","10:42, 26 Oct 2024",Politics,"SIR Keir Starmer denied lying to Brits over plans to hike their taxes - as he promised them “light at the end of the tunnel”. Labour are expected to drop a £35 billion tax bomb on the UK in their Budget on Wednesday. It includes a hugely controversial tax hike on employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs) by up to 2 per cent. The move will cost firms up to £20 billion. Speaking at a press conference in Samoa this morning, the PM insisted the pain would be worth it to fix Britain’s broken public services. He said: ""What I want to be judged on, one, have we made people better off? ""Do they feel better off under a Labour government because we fix the foundations. ""Secondly, that we genuinely pick the NHS up, put it back on its feet, but also at the same time reimagine it and make it fit for the future. ""That is as much about reform and technology as it is about money. There is no investment without reform as far as I'm concerned."" Labour promised not to raise taxes on “working people” - including NICs, income tax and VAT. But they have been accused of lying to Brits as Budget leaks suggest employer NICs will go up, while income tax thresholds will be frozen - forcing people to pay more tax on their wages. Sir Keir was accused by ex-Tory Chancellor Lord Norman Lamont of stoking ""class war"". It came after he said that ""working people"" do not make money from renting property or owning stocks and shares. Asked directly if he “misled” Brits with his tax pledge, the PM said: “No."" He continued: “We were very clear about the tax rises that we would necessarily have to make up, whatever the circumstances and you've listed them there and I listed them, I don't know how many times in the campaign. “We were really clear in the manifesto about and in the campaign that we wouldn't be increasing taxes on working people and spelt out what we meant by that in terms of income tax, in terms of NICs and in terms of VAT, and we intend to keep the promises that we made in our manifesto.” THE Budget is big news and where you'll often hear announcements about taxes. But what exactly is it? The Budget is when the Government outlines its plans for the economy including taxation and spending. The Chancellor of the Exchequer delivers a speech in the House of Commons and announces plans for things like tax hikes, cuts and changes to Universal Credit and the minimum wage. At the same time, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) publishes an independent analysis of the UK economy. Usually, the Budget is a once-a-year event and usually takes place in the Autumn, with a smaller update known as the Spring Statement. But there have been exceptions in recent years when there have been more updates, or the announcements have taken place at different times, for example during the pandemic or when there is a General Election. On the day of the Budget, usually a Wednesday, the Chancellor is photographed outside No 11 Downing Street with the red box. She then heads to the House of Commons to deliver her speech, at around 12.30 following Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs). Changes announced in the Budget are sometimes implemented the same day, while others may not have a set date. For example, a change to tobacco duty usually happens on the same day, pushing up the price of cigarettes. Some tax changes are set to come in at the start of a new tax year, which is April 6. Other changes may need to pass through Parliament before coming into law. Asked for his definition of “working people”, Sir Keir previously told Sky it was someone who “goes out and earns their living, usually paid in a sort of monthly cheque” but cannot “write a cheque to get out of difficulties”. Pressed if this included people with assets, said: “Well, they wouldn't come within my definition.” Tory shadow minister Claire Coutinho blasted: “Keir Starmer went into an election saying he’d protect working people only to define that as a subset of people with jobs once he won. “Labour either had no plan for post election or straight up lied to the public on multiple fronts.” The warning came as Rachel Reeves sparked fears of mortgage rate pain after ripping up her debt rules. The Chancellor confirmed plans to change the way national debt is calculated to hand herself up to £50billion more to play with at next week’s Budget. It will let her embark on a massive borrowing spree to fund key manifesto pledges while still claiming to have met her promise to have debt falling in five years’ time.  But the financial fiddling risks spooking the markets in a Liz Truss-style panic, with government borrowing costs sent soaring yesterday as a result. Shadow Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the move could force interest rates to remain high for longer and wreak more misery on homeowners remortgaging."

Every year the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) takes nominations from across the country for its Champion Beer of Britain award. This competition is one of the most coveted and well-respected competitions in the world and can put the winner firmly in the national and international spotlight. All beers must be nominated by individual CAMRA members and a tasting panel. They then compete in regional competitions using a strict blind tasting policy. There are seven judging categories: The shortlist has been whittled down and one winner was crowned at a ceremony in Newark on Wednesday. Crouch Vale’s Amarillo was named the overall winner after a hard-fought final round of judging. It has an ABV of 5% and is made with American hops. The beer was described by Christine Cryne, the judging panel organiser, as having “a tangy aroma with a faint note of biscuit”. She added: “The flavour is full of tropical and citrus notes on a sweet biscuit base. Dry sweetish bitter finish. A full flavoured beer.” Christine described it as a “commendable winner, worthy of the respected title despite exceptionally strong competition”. Brewery directors Colin and Fiona Bocking said they were “delighted” to have bagged the award after previously winning it in 2005 and 2006. The beer can be bought through the brewery’s website or at a selection of pubs and farm shops across the UK. Eight 500ml bottles are available for £20.26 on the Crouch Vale website. Silver prize winner was the IPA from Anspach and Hobday, which has a 6% ABV. Judges said it is a “wonderful fruity new world IPA”.   It has aromas of citrus and tropical fruit which are “perfectly balanced by the bitterness, leading to a dry, spicy finish.” It can be bought online through the brewery’s website. In bronze was the Trawlerboys Best Bitter from Green Jack Brewery, which has an ABV of 4.6%. It was described by judges as being an “attractive orangey brown beer with a honey biscuit nose”. Judges said it is “complex and very drinkable”.  It is available on the Green Jack website.
