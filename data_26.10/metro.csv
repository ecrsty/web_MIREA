								video Thousands of Tommy Robinson supporters marched through central London today. A demonstration left Victoria Station to reach Westminster before it was ground to a halt at Buckingham Gate. ‘Shall we burst through and f*** [the police] up?’ one man shouted. Others urged for calm, with one saying: ‘The police are trying to rile us up. It is a disgrace. We need to try and stay calm. ‘We started, why have we stopped? We need to smile. They want a problem.’ Later there was ‘a brief moment of shoving’ near the stage of an anti-fascist counter-protest, leading to two arrests, according to police. One was arrested for a public order offence and a breach of the peace, while the other was arrested for a racially aggravated public order offence. Police subsequently de-arrested one of them. Chants of ‘Oh Tommy, Tommy’ carried as the main demonstration reached Parliament where it was met with heavy police presence. People at the front of the march carried a sign with ‘Two tier Keir fuelled the riots’ written on it. Other cards said ‘Bring back Rwanda’ and ‘Stop the Boats’. Some appeared to chant ‘Who the f*** is Allah?’ and ‘We want Tommy out!’ while drinking from beer cans. To get the latest news from the capital visit Metro.co.uk's London news hub. Although Robinson wasn’t at the protest in person, he did appear in a video message in which he criticised alleged two-tier policing and London’s Ulez charges. The crowd booed when an image of Prime Minister Keir Starmer appeared on the same screen at the front of the demonstration. Far-right activist Tommy Robinson is absent from the protest – that he organised – after being charged with a terror offence on Friday. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was remanded into custody by police on Friday. He is accused of being in contempt of court following the airing of a film at a rally in central London. After attending Folkestone Police station, he was separately charged with failing to provide his mobile phone pin to police under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, Kent Police said. A post from his X account last night said: ‘We do not care if you are black, brown, white or green, what we care about are shared values, our culture, and the direction of our nation.’ Former GB News host Laurence Fox, who dubbed Robinson a ‘political prisoner’, pulled out of the protest over concerns it would not proceed peacefully. In a post on X, the former actor said: ‘Having been involved in the planning and funding of the previous marches and having some understanding of the huge efforts required to make these events pass peacefully, I am concerned that the current climate makes our task even more onerous. ‘I am not sufficiently reassured that the preparations which have been put in place to ensure the first marches passed so peacefully is sufficiently robust to make sure this one does the same. I am sincerely looking forward to being proved wrong.’ Riot police arrived at Westminster ahead of the demonstration, which set off more than an hour ahead of an agreed 12.30pm start time. Many of the the English Defence League founder’s supporters are holding signs saying ‘enough is enough’ and ‘immigrants are not welcome, stop rewarding, start deporting, defend our borders’. There are chants of ‘free Tommy Robinson’, ‘we want Tommy out’ and ‘who the f*** is Allah, I’m England until I die’ from attendees. One protester told Metro: ‘This is all about freedom. The country is corrupt.’ Counter-protesters gather at the other end of Whitehall after a march from Regent Street, organised by Stand Up To Racism, which described it as a ‘massive anti-fascist demonstration’. Both demonstrations are supposed to remain static, but police are on site in case tensions bubble over. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Rachel Williams said: ‘We are well prepared for what is set to be a busy day in the centre of London. ‘Our role is to ensure that those attending the various events can do so safely and that they can exercise their right to lawful protest. ‘We will have significant resources in place to respond to any incidents, to deal decisively with any offences, and to keep disruption to other members of the public and businesses to a minimum. ‘We know that when groups with opposing views come together it can lead to conflict and disorder and a key part of our role is ensuring that does not happen. ‘We have used Public Order Act conditions to ensure that those involved stick to routes and assembly areas that are sufficiently far apart.

Hospital staff watched young woman die on CCTV thinking she was asleep,Sam Corbishley,"Oct 26, 2024, 5:53pm",,"Home,News,UK","Hospital staff watched a young woman lie dying on the floor for more than an hour because they thought she was asleep, an inquest has been told. Shannara Donnelly, 22, was supposed to be watched ‘at all times’ after being deemed a risk of self-harm while at Chase Farm Hospital in Enfield, north London. But medical staff wrongly monitored her using cameras and missed her collapsing in her room at the unit on June 19. The inquest at George Meehan House in Wood Green heard that when they saw Shannara lying on the floor, they assumed she was sleeping, and she remained there for over an hour. The hearing, which is expected to last up to two weeks, was told she died ‘apparently by her own hands’. Shannara, known to her family as Jade, had reported previous sexual abuse, had struggled with alcohol abuse and sometimes heard ‘voices’ in her head, the inquest has heard. Her mum, Kerry Donnelly, explained that Jade had struggled during lockdown and had recently lost three close members of her family before her death. She said of her daughter: ‘The pain was sometimes just too unbearable for her. As such, she had stayed in different places whilst she tried to get help and where she would be safe. ‘Tragically, whilst in [the care of Chase Farm Hospital] on June 19, a very beautiful leaf fell from our family tree, but the memories of Jade will remain deep-rooted in our hearts forever.’ The court has heard that despite a note on her health documents stating she shouldn’t be sent to Chase Farm Hospital following a previous incident, Jade was again admitted to the unit after previous stays at St Ann’s Hospital in Haringey. Area Coroner Tony Murphy read admissions from the Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust, including that Jade ‘shouldn’t have been sent’ to Chase Farm Hospital, that her risk assessment was inadequate, and that she ‘should have been within eyesight observations’. The Trust further admitted that necessary safety checks were not carried out by nursing staff at the facility, which was also housing another patient at the time, and that CCTV observations by staff were an inadequate form of observation. Additionally, no staff on shift were compliant with their life support training and of the two oxygen tanks kept at the unit, one was empty and the other missing an essential attachment. CCTV footage played to jurors from the day of Jade’s death showed members of staff observing the girl on cameras and through ‘peephole’ windows, but not completing observations required under her level of care. Mark Pritchard, Managing Director at Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust, began his evidence by apologising to Jade’s family. ‘I want to offer my sincere condolences, on behalf of the Trust, for the shortcomings in Jade’s death,’ he said. Mr Murphy took the court through the Trust’s policy guidelines for patients under Level Three care, which Jade was under, which states they should be within sight ‘at all times’. Guidelines also stated that though CCTV observation could be used to support staff, ‘it should not be used in place of observations and engagement’. They also stated patients should be observed ‘attentively’. Mr Murphy asked Mr Pritchard: ‘Does it appear to you that, during the footage you saw, that Jade’s observation was conducted by staff attentively?’ He answered: ‘No, I don’t believe it was.’ Jade’s family’s lawyer, Ross Beaton, later questioned Mr Pritchard on whether Jade’s level of care was provided effectively. Mr Beaton said: ‘Level Three means being within eyesight unless [the patient] is in the bathroom, in which case you will be in verbal contact [with them]. ‘Did you see any Level Three observations [in the CCTV footage]?’ Mr Pritchard replied: ‘The bulk of it, I would say no. The overarching answer is no.’ Jane Basemera, Jade’s allocated nurse on the day of her death, told the court the patient would have lived had she been on Level Four observations. Ms Basemera, who broke down in tears during her evidence, said: ‘If a patient has [tried to use a] ligature, it should be arm’s length [Level Four care]. ‘Arms-length observations would have saved Jade.’ Mr Murphy said: ‘It does appear that some very significant events that occurred to Jade during the time in the bathroom were missed.’ Heartbreaking tributes to boy, 14, found dead after vanishing on way to school Boy, 2, and girl, 8, in hospital after stabbing attack in east London Arrests after thousands take part in Tommy Robinson march and counter protest Maps show where Tommy Robinson march and counter-protest are happening in London today Ms Basemera accepted that this was true, but also spoke of staffing issues at the unit, saying Jade should have had two nurses looking after her. The nurse admitted she’d been told that Jade was on the floor but hadn’t been told of her collapse. If she had been told, she said she would have known ‘without a doubt’ that something was wrong, the inquest heard. The inquest continues.

Warning ahead of Manchester City match after body found near stadium,Danny Rigg,"Oct 26, 2024, 2:58pm","Oct 26, 2024, 4:47pm","Home,News,UK","Football fans have been told to find alternative routes to Manchester City’s ground after a body was found by a canalside path to the Etihad Stadium. Police have taped off an area around Ashton Canal, where the body – believed to be a man – was discovered this morning, Manchester Evening News reported. The death is not believed to be suspicious, but emergency services and a forensic tent remained on the scene until shortly before today’s match at the nearby grounds. Police tape blocks off a section of Clayton Lane and a canal towpath, a popular route to the Etihad Stadium, which is less than a mile away. Manchester City is hosting Southampton at the stadium for a Premier League match with a 3pm kick off. Several police cars and an ambulance were on the scene, according to eyewitnesses.

Nostradamus and Baba Vanga both made the same chilling prediction for 2025,Gergana Krasteva,"Oct 26, 2024, 12:26pm","Oct 26, 2024, 3:40pm","Home,News,World","Baba Vanga and Nostradamus – who are known worldwide for their uncannily accurate prophecies – have made the same exact prediction for 2025. Both have foretold troubling futures – about aliens making contact with humans, a supposed assassination attempt on Vladimir Putin, terrorist attacks in Europe and about King Charles’ reign. With 2025 knocking on our doorstep, their prophecies are yet again in the spotlight. Both mystics have made chilling claims that there will be a conflict in Europe next year. Baba Vanga, often described as the ‘Nostradamus of the Balkans’, predicted a war in Europe for 2025, which she said would ‘devastate’ the continent’s population. As if the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine is not harrowing enough, she saidthat a new conflict will erupt between two countries. Bulgaria’s legendary mystic made a name for herself across Europe predicting the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine, the death of Princess Diana, New York’s 9/11, even her own death on August 11, 1996, at the age of 85, her followers claim. For those who have somehow never come across her life story, she lived in Rupite, a small mountainous village to which various eastern European and Soviet leaders trekked to just for a chance to seek her wisdom. Blind since early childhood, she was semi-literate in Bulgarian and although she did not record her prophecies, her followers wrote them down, later turning them into books.

Ex-Chelsea and England star Frank Lampard speaks out after face is found in £38m drugs bust,Tom Olver,"Oct 26, 2024, 9:53am","Oct 26, 2024, 11:59am","Home,Sport,Football","Ex-Chelsea and England footballer Frank Lampard was left near-speechless after he was informed that pictures of his face had been discovered in a £38million drugs bust in Australia. Two duffel bags were seized by the Australian Federal Police and each and every brick – containing ‘ice meth’ – had bizarrely been stamped with photos of a suited-up Lampard giving a thumbs up. The picture in question was taken while Lampard was giving a lap of honour at Stamford Bridge back in 2017 and appears on the former midfielder’s Wikipedia page. Richard Prothero, an alleged trafficker, was arrested at gunpoint during the enormous haul, which occurred in the car park of Sydney’s Maroubra Surf Club. The 37-year-old was subsequently charged with attempting to possess a commercial quantity of border-controlled drugs. He made no application for bail while appearing in court. The 95kg shipment of methamphetamine had been tracked from Los Angeles, before it wound up in east Sydney. It goes without saying that Lampard, who was capped 106 times by the England national team, had no involvement whatsoever in the drugs ring and the 46-year-old could hardly believe his eyes when shown snaps from the incident. ‘Yeah, you probably know my answer on that one,’ a baffled Lampard told The Sun outside his west London home. ‘What am I gonna say about that? I’m not aware of it. ‘I don’t even know what to say to you to be honest. I’ve literally no comment on that.’ According to reports Down Under, the drug producer in question may be a Chelsea supporter which could explain why Lampard’s face had been plastered all over the stash. It is believed the image of Lampard may be a trademark of the criminal gang supplying the illegal substance. ‘Methamphetamine, like all illicit drugs, causes psychological, financial and social harm to users, their loved ones and the broader community,’ Australian Federal Police Detective Chief Superintendent Kristie Cressy said in a statement. ‘Criminals do not care about the harm they cause. They are motivated by the profits they can make. Across Australia there were 10,100 methamphetamine-related hospitalisations in 2021-2022 – which equates to more than 27 every day on average. ‘This has an impact on the health system that can negatively affect the entire community. Investigations like this show the resolve and relentlessness of our investigators in making Australia a hostile environment for organised crime.’ Back in 2012, Lampard’s former Chelsea and England team-mate, John Terry, sought legal action against Golden Flake after images of his face and torso were used on packets of Indian cigarettes. 'I coached Cole Palmer with England - he's brilliant but has one weakness' West Ham tipped to sign 'very good' Chelsea star after Enzo Maresca treatment Didi Hamann says Arsenal star has 'gone backwards' and will only get worse Alan Shearer's Premier League predictions including 'huge' Arsenal vs Liverpool clash A spokesman for Elite Management, the firm representing Terry, insisted the Indian government has sought no permission to use the picture. ‘Disgusting from this company Gold Flake using my image on their cigarettes,’ the ex-Three Lions captain told his followers on social media at the time. I hate smoking!’ Lampard, widely regarded as one of the finest midfielders of his generation, has been out of a job since his interim spell as Chelsea manager came to an end at the conclusion of the 2022/23 season. He has, though, worked in various punditry roles for the BBC, TNT Sports and Amazon Prime in recent months. For more stories like this, check our sport page.

My husband never bothers with affection or foreplay — our sex life is a one-way street,Laura Collins,"Oct 26, 2024, 6:00pm",,"Home,Lifestyle,Sex","Even if you don’t give your partner pleasure to receive it in return, when sex is continually one-sided, it can leave you feeling short-changed. In this week’s Sex Column, we hear from a reader whose husband is neglecting her needs in the bedroom, avoiding foreplay altogether and skipping straight to what he enjoys. When he’s had a drink, he has no trouble giving his wife the affection she craves — but by this point, she’s feeling anything but receptive. Read the advice below, but before you go, don’t forget to check out last week’s column, from a woman who’s struggling to come to terms with the revelation her boyfriend is a cross-dresser. My husband has lots of qualities but one of them isn’t that he’s a great romantic. He rarely shows me any affection unless he’s been drinking, and then he’s full of undying love and all over me like the proverbial rash. But at the very time he’s trying to be all lovey-dovey, I just feel annoyed because I feel it’s the drink talking. The rest of the time, when we’re in bed and he’s stone cold sober, he never bothers to try to turn me on, and just jumps on me for sex without any foreplay at all. (Sorry if this is too much information but I don’t know how else to say it.) I’ve tried talking to him about it but he only gets annoyed and I often end up in tears. I love him very much and apart from the sex issue, he’d do anything for me. We’re both in our late twenties and have been together just over three years. We’ve always had the same problem, which I imagined would improve with time, but no such luck. I’ve tried pointing him to useful websites, or giving him books on the subject, but he flatly refuses to engage. I’ve told him the things I enjoy, which ought to be obvious to any man trying to please his wife sexually, but he won’t do them. I always take the trouble for him, so why can’t I have some pleasure in return? This issue is making me really unhappy but it doesn’t seem to bother him. Assuming everything else is good in your relationship, don’t give up just yet. If your husband can be loving and affectionate when drunk, he can be loving and affectionate when sober. However, this problem need to be addressed, as intimacy should never be a one-way street. It seems as if it’s something that actually bothers him a great deal, despite him showing it in a different way. The fact that he gets annoyed when you try talking about it is likely a defence mechanism, and while I’m sure he doesn’t want you to end up in tears, at least when you do, the focus is temporarily off him. Your husband may have been brought up in a household where he was expected to behave in a tough, unemotional way. But buried beneath that ‘manly’ exterior is the sensitive and affectionate lover he can be when alcohol lowers the barriers and releases his inhibitions. It’s important to focus on the positives when broaching this, as pointing out any shortcomings in the bedroom will just make him feel worse and more defensive. Instead, try boosting his confidence by telling him how the thought of great sex with him turns you on, and how wonderful it is when he does certain things to you. I asked my partner to plan a date night - his idea of romance left me shocked ‘Talk dirty to me,’ I said - then my lover went quiet There's a phrase that people hate even more than 'live, laugh, love' I haven't had sex in two years, but I'm ready to end my dry spell Additionally, you could look at taking more of an initiative so that you’re the one doing the seducing, which gives you greater control of what happens and how. Maybe he just needs a bit of practical ‘teaching’ about what feels good. Making this a fun thing, where you’re both exploring new ways to improve your sex life, is key to getting him on board. Hopefully he starts to make more of an effort, but either way, a few sessions with a sex therapist will help you (and him) get to the root of his issues. Laura is a counsellor and columnist.

Think twice before you label Strictly Come Dancing’s Shayne Ward,Adam Miller,"Oct 26, 2024, 4:00pm",,"Home,Entertainment,TV","If you’re old enough to remember Shayne Ward on The X Factor, you’ll recall the hold he had on millions of us back in 2005. It helped that he wouldn’t look out of place in a Dolce & Gabbana advert and had an impeccable falsetto when male popstars hitting those high notes was all the rage. Listen to Daniel Bedingfield and Justin Timberlake for reference. But is that alone enough to win one of the biggest public votes of the 00s? No, the public have to love you for you, too. Shayne looked like a model and sounded like pop prince but ultimately he was a humble lad from Manchester you could easily find in any town centre centre folding clothes or pulling pints. He was a confident performer, sure, but he wasn’t cocky. There’s a fine line between the two and for some reason 20 years later, now he’s appearing on The X Factor’s rival series Strictly Come Dancing, viewers think that line has been crossed. But has it? Considering he was famed for his ballads as a popstar, Shayne is actually a much better dancer than I was expecting. Not to diminish his underrated up-tempo bops like No You Hang Up, but when I think of Shayne Ward I don’t think of dancer. To my surprise, he’s actually pretty decent and has so far proven to be a dab-hand at all the styles of the ballroom. His American Smooth last weekend felt effortless, and his chemistry with professional partner Nancy Xu has never felt stronger. The week before his Cha-cha was fun, even if it was a little bit clunky. The judges loved it and he was sitting pretty comfortably at fifth on the leaderboard going into the public vote. He should have been a safe bet to sail through to week five but against all odds he found himself in the bottom two with Nick Knowles, eventually saved by the judges. It was the confirmation Shayne didn’t need: The public have hung up. He’s since been spared the dance-off for one weekend, but is tipped by bookies to end up there again tonight for Halloween Week. It’s unclear why Strictly viewers aren’t gelling with Shayne, but glancing on social media, the overwhelming response is he’s ‘arrogant’ because he said at the beginning of the contest he’s ‘in it to win it’. Granted, the competitive nature of Strictly Come Dancing has been increasingly scrutinised since the sacking of Graziano Di Prima and probe into Giovanni Pernice’s teaching style in training. On one side, people have said Strictly is just a bit of fun while others are adamant it is still a dance contest, which as we’ve seen time and time again can also really boost someone’s career. But can’t it be both? Of course, Shayne is in it to win it – and quite rightly, he’s not the only one. Every single one of them is willingly pushing themselves to breaking point because they all want to survive another week and ultimately lift the Glitterball trophy. There’s a reason no one has rejected the Glitterball trophy – everyone wants to take it home. Why wouldn’t you? At least Shayne was honest about it. I can’t say I’m picking up the phone voting for Shayne to win. It’s going to take a lot for me to vote for anyone other than Montell (Chris, you don’t need my vote), but I’m absolutely baffled that he’s not a safe bet each week, and has been accused of being overly confident. After his American Smooth last Saturday, Shirley Ballas had some welcome advice for Shayne. She said: ‘What I want you to search for now, just a little deeper, is your authentic self. ‘Who are you really? You don’t need to put a show on for anybody except yourself. You are that good.’ She’s right, too. Part of the reason the public isn’t engaging with Shayne is because they’re struggling to see the real him. But is that cockiness? If anything, to me, he looks nervous and a little overwhelmed no doubt triggered by exaggerated and unwarranted backlash to one of the first comments he made on the show. Unlike other contestants, with exception of fell X Factor alumni JB Gill of JLS fame, Shayne has ridden this rodeo before. He’s given himself up to the security of the public vote each week and experienced the extraordinary level of attention that comes with it. No wonder JB was also in the bottom despite being one of the best dancers of the series. If both contestants are struggling to let viewers in, it’s not because they’re arrogant – far from it. Netflix drama with 331,000,000 hours watched is a total mystery to me Giovanni Pernice's unbeaten Strictly record will finally be broken this Saturday Strictly star reveals how the show has spiced things up in bedroom with wife ‘Talk dirty to me,’ I said - then my lover went quiet It’s likely because they’ve been in this position before, under much more intense circumstances when The X Factor was in its prime, and dipping their toes back into that environment must be intimidating beyond anything I could comprehend. Will Shayne win Strictly? No, and he shouldn’t. He’s up against much better dancers and characters but he shouldn’t be tortured with false accusations of being too competitive.

My daughter got caught in a hailstorm and it changed her forever,Emily Streeter,"Oct 26, 2024, 1:00pm",,"Home,Lifestyle,Families","I watch as my 11-year-old paces from window to window, hands pressed so tightly over her ears that her fingernails break skin. I’ve seen this before – the panic, the screams, the vomit – and my heart breaks because there’s nothing I can do for her. Other times I’ve tried to hold her, but she wriggles free. We’ve drawn curtains, but she wants to watch. And so I’ve held her hair back when it’s so bad she vomits. What we thought she’d grow out of, has become a 10-year battle against ombrophobia (fear of rain), astraphobia (fear of storms), ancraophobia (fear of wind), and emetophobia (fear of vomiting). This isn’t the way most react to rain. While you or I might pull up a hood or run for cover, Poppy goes into full fight or flight mode. But she wasn’t always like this. As a toddler she was content and adventurous. She loved the woods, and hunting fairies. She was happy. All the time. Then, when she was two years old, the hailstorm happened. It had been a hot day – I was in flip flops, Poppy had bare legs and feet – then out of nowhere, daylight vanished and was replaced by dark, heavy clouds. The air became still for a moment, before hailstones began to fall. They were large, heavy, and unrelenting. Poppy was strapped in the buggy, so I stood over her, shielding her with my back. I possibly screamed in shock, but I knew the storm would pass. And then it was over, the sun returned, it was as if nothing had happened. But that moment changed everything. I know because when a therapist or doctor asks what started it, I always come back to that storm. Since then, Poppy’s fear of rain has intensified. By the age of six she could tell you what a jet stream was because her incessant need to know what is happening has also educated her beyond her years. When she got her first phone at nine, she began to fixate on weather apps and started to track lightning as far away as Italy. In lighter moments, we joke that she’ll become a meteorologist, or a storm chaser. Well-meaning people suggest removing the apps, but we feel like knowledge is power, and she needs to be in control of something that is uncontrollable. For her, knowing what might be coming is as good as it is ever going to get. But life has become increasingly hard for us all – earlier this month, she started secondary school and on day three, we had 15 millimetres of rain in an hour. She came home. While peers were forming friendships and navigating halls, she was under a duvet, her head in my lap, and fingers in her ears. The only way I could get her back into school was urging her to trust me that it wouldn’t happen again. Not that I could be certain of this. Two weeks later, another hailstorm came – and she was not prepared – it wasn’t forecast. Hailstones flew through the lobby doors, flooding parts of her school. By the time I arrived, she was pacing, stressed, screaming for me to ‘save her’. She had vomited in the bin and genuinely thought she would die. School staff tried to help by offering umbrellas and ear defenders, but when she shuts down, nothing helps. What also made matters worse was that, the day before, she was told that the weather was ‘not going to get any better’ by a teacher. I understood it was likely an off-the-cuff comment, maybe made with the intention of toughening her up, but they clearly had no knowledge of how severe her anxiety is. Instead it only belittled a fear that has blighted her entire childhood and has had a catastrophic effect on her ability to rationalise, to be optimistic and to put her trust in a system that I think may well be too black and white to ever accommodate her. It’s been three weeks since then and in that time she has only been back to school twice. I believe she has PTSD from being in that lobby, because the worst of all her fears trapped her there – without me. Now she looks at the grey sky every morning and asks me if it’s the same grey sky as it was on that day. Or she’ll ask me why I sent her in, would I have if we knew, will I get there quicker if it happens again? It leaves me feeling wretched. When we sought help from our GP, we were told she’d grow out of it, but as her fears have deepened since, we knew we had to do more. We’ve paid for private counselling for the last five years, we have tried hypnotherapy and herbalists, exposure therapy and EMDR. I’ve even written to celebrity therapists, the Speakmans. Twice. My heart is ragged and I’m exhausted, but I still feel like I’ve not done enough. I didn’t see how bad it was getting until it was too late. I wish I’d tackled it earlier, pushed her in front of medical professionals, and got her on the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) NHS waiting list sooner. I’m worried now more than ever – scientists at the Met Office have found that rainfall associated with storms is becoming both more intense and more likely. There is an increased amount of rainfall, making them about 20% more severe. For families like ours, that’s alarming. We prepare our house like you’d prepare for a disaster: curtains drawn, TV volume up, buckets on standby. While we are still trying to understand and manage Poppy’s condition, we need others to recognise that, for some, weather isn’t just an inconvenience, it’s a source of genuine terror. Don’t dismiss it as a ‘fuss’ or tell us she’ll grow out of it. Understand that her fear is real and debilitating – listen to her. There’s nothing more frustrating than when you’re deep in a fear and no one will take you seriously.

We weather watch, miss chunks of school and turn down invites. I worry that her friends will stop reaching out, that they’ll give up on her. And I miss hearing about her day – we are never apart so there is nothing for her to tell me. For now, we’re looking into homeschooling Poppy, which was something we never wanted to do. I believe school is much more than lessons and learning – Poppy is funny, and kind and so sociable that confining her to our home feels as wrong as caging a bird. But when we have to battle every day to get her out of the house, isn’t that when we have to admit defeat? We have to allow her to finally feel safe and as her mother, I will do anything to protect her. Do you have a story you’d like to share? Get in touch by emailing jess.austin@metro.co.uk.

My dad was told he’d never play sport then led Great Britain to victory in 1972,,"Oct 26, 2024, 3:00pm",,"Home,Lifestyle,Families","My dad, Clive Sullivan, was always terrified of heights. He hated going up ladders to fix the guttering, or anything like that. He really couldn’t bear it. Then, one day when I was around 10, he mentioned he’d been in the army as a paratrooper. ‘But Dad… you’re scared of heights!’, I said, bewildered. ‘I know,’ he said. ‘That’s why I joined the paratroopers – to try and cure my fear.’ That sums up exactly who my dad was. He was determined never to let fear get the better of him, or let anything stop him. He was resilient, tough and brave. My dad wasn’t in the paratroopers for very long – not because of his fear of heights, but because he went on to become a world-class rugby player. My father, Clive Sullivan, has been described as a ‘Welsh rugby league legend’ and as ‘one of Hull’s greatest sporting heroes’, playing for both Hull FC and Hull Kingston Rovers, as well as internationally. In 1972, he captained Great Britain – making him the first Black athlete to captain a British national team. Of course, that’s a phenomenal achievement. But for me, the achievement is in being captain of a rugby team, in and of itself. And not just any rugby team; that year, Britain won the 1972 Rugby League World Cup. For me, the fact that he was captain of a World Cup-winning team speaks more about him than anything else. My dad was born in 1943 in Splott, a suburb of Cardiff, and it wasn’t likely from the outset that he’d become a rugby player. My mother informs me that, as a young boy, he had some form of muscle disease that was never fully diagnosed. He had to spend some time with his legs in plaster and was told that he would never play any sport. It was uncertain whether he’d even be able to walk too well, let alone run. But he joined the army in 1961, after he left school. While he was based with the army in Yorkshire, he was told to play in an army rugby match – my understanding is, they said something along the lines of: Because he was Welsh, he ‘must’ play rugby. And that was how it all began. He played brilliantly – and he realised that, against the odds, he could play rugby; hopefully professionally. He went to a trial at Bradford Northern. They said no; but he then had a trial at Hull, who signed him. After he left the army in 1964, his career went from strength to strength – with him becoming Hull FC’s leading try-scorer and being famous for his incredible speed. He started playing internationally in 1967 and played three World Cup matches in 1968. Then, in 1972, he captained Great Britain. Strangely enough, I don’t remember him speaking too much about that at the time – but then, I would have only been four. But he was a very proud Welshman. He had such pride in his heritage, and in his country – so I can only imagine how proud and pleased he must have been to captain his country in a World Cup; and then, for his team to go on to win. He joined Hull Kingston Rovers in 1974, and one particular memory I have is of the 1980 Challenge Cup Final, where Dad played for Hull KR against Hull FC. I would have been about 11 – it meant so much to me to go to Wembley to watch, not only as a supporter of Hull KR but as Clive Sullivan’s son. I remember how nervous Dad was in the buildup, and what a big deal it was to him. He’d always wanted to play the Challenge Cup Final, and he’d started to think he may never do it. Hull KR won and Dad even went on to play in another Challenge Cup Final in 1982. It was success after success; but I’ve been told, by his ex-teammates, opponents and people who knew him, that not only was he a great rugby player, he was also a great man. That he had time for people, he was always friendly, and he was a great teammate. Hearing that makes me prouder than any number of career highlights. And for me, Dad was just that: My dad. We used to go and watch him play rugby, but this public character who grew out of his myriad achievements isn’t something I ever really identified with him; at least until recent years, when there’s been increasing recognition of everything he accomplished. October marks Black History Month, which reflects on the achievements, cultures and contributions of Black people in the UK and across the globe, as well as educating others about the diverse history of those from African and Caribbean descent. For more information about the events and celebrations that are taking place this year, visit the official Black History Month website.   With my dad working full-time, playing rugby on the weekends, we didn’t get to see him that much; and he died when we were relatively young. There’s still so much I don’t know about him. I do remember, though, that he would never let me win. Whether it was football in the back garden, play wrestling, cards, Monopoly, Scrabble – Dad was very, very competitive. Whether I ever actually won or not, I can’t remember; but I know it was always a struggle to beat him. And what I learned from that – from him – was: If you’re going to do something, you do it to the best of your ability. And you keep trying until that’s the case. This idea of striving to do well, and striving to improve, is something I took with me into my own career. I was an international rugby player myself – but my dad never saw me play. He was diagnosed with cancer in 1985, when I was 16. It was all so sudden – he’d only just stopped playing professionally, and he was still coaching, so he was still relatively fit at the time. It was such a shock. The effect both the disease and the treatment had on him, watching him fade before our eyes, is something I’ll never forget. He passed away just months after his diagnosis, age 42. Looking back, it was like a click of the fingers. The aftermath of his death was incredibly difficult for me. Not only had I lost my father, but it was all far too public. I understand people wanted to express their grief, and the level of public interest shows the level of high esteem he was held in by supporters of Hull FC and Hull KR, the rugby league community, and the city of Hull. I don’t have any resentment for that. But I’m quite shy, and not as social as my father – and I wanted to be left to deal with my grief myself, in my own way. And I just didn’t feel we could do that. Now, I’m fine with the fact that he didn’t see me play – but I still wish I could have had the chance to have had conversations with him about the experience of playing rugby professionally and internationally. Growing up, I played soccer and did athletics. It wasn’t until a friend of my father’s asked if I wanted to play rugby, when I was around 15 that I started following in my dad’s footsteps. I imagine having my father’s name to live up to spurred me on a little. I played at the same club, Hull KR, in the same position – on the wing. So there were always going to be comparisons. He cast a long shadow – but I was simultaneously glad that, when I played, it made people remember my dad and his abilities. Gradually, my attitude matured from feeling as though I was in a battle with my father’s legacy to being one of acceptance. I started to think: ‘I’m my own player, and I do my own thing. And if you want to remember the things my dad achieved because I’m on the field, then I’m perfectly happy with that’. Dad has since been commemorated in so many wonderful ways. The A63 road in Hull was renamed Clive Sullivan Way; and he was one of six inaugural members to be inducted into Hull FC’s Hall of Fame in 1993. Then, in 2022, he joined the British Rugby League Hall of Fame. That was such a special evening for me. The history of rugby is within that Hall of Fame. Not only was it a milestone for my father’s legacy; it meant so much to me, as someone who was ‘in’ the rugby world, to be there and witness it. I understood the gravitas of what this honour meant for my dad. My father left a huge legacy and he was certainly a pioneer. Pro-life mum of seven insists on going ahead with ectopic pregnancy I fell in love after 15 minutes and he hadn't said a word I asked my partner to plan a date night - his idea of romance left me shocked My daughter got caught in a hailstorm and it changed her forever But nobody who comes up to me, when they speak about my father, mentions the colour of his skin. They mention his character, and how he had time for people. They tell me how friendly he was, how he was a wonderful teammate and a great team leader, captaining Great Britain to victory. Who you are; how you behave; how you act; this is what we should all ultimately hold in esteem. I believe that being a genuinely good person, and striving to always be that, are examples for all. This is what people always bring up in connection with my father; and if anything is his legacy, it should be that.

I know my disability makes me a better parent,Dayna Latham,"Oct 26, 2024, 2:00pm",,"Home,Lifestyle,Families","When we first found out I was pregnant in 2022, I was tempted to go into full panic mode. I was elated, but I also knew my health and finances were already hanging on by a thread. So my partner and I sat down and plotted. The only reason I knew I’d make it through in one piece was because of the confidence and ability to stay calm during a crisis that disability has instilled in me. This skill, of course, transfers rather nicely into parenthood. This is just one example of how I believe my disabilities make me a better parent. Don’t get me wrong: There absolutely are days where I feel my disabilities hold me back. Days I feel deep, all consuming guilt for not being able to parent ‘like other mums’. But I’ve recently realised that navigating disability has greatly improved five skills that I’ve found integral to parenthood: resourcefulness, gratitude, patience, budgeting and self-confidence. I have hyper-mobile Ehlers Danlos syndrome (hEDS), spina bifida, scoliosis and endometriosis. I also have diagnoses of borderline personality disorder (BPD), ADHD and complex PTSD. In oversimplified terms, this means my joints are painful and prone to dislocate, and my spine is incredibly wonky and sore. I have near-constant pelvic pain and really rough periods. My health was supposed to make conceiving, carrying and caring for a child much harder than it has, with my medical team warning me throughout my 20s that I was likely infertile, which I spent years trying to come to terms with. So our daughter, Dalia, was a surprise pregnancy – born on July 19, 2023. I struggled greatly throughout my pregnancy – with every single health issue I have flaring worse than ever before. I also had to have a planned C-section due to my spinal issues. I’m grateful to have the support of my partner, Tim – my child’s non-disabled father – as well as a large support system of family living nearby. Now, through a lot of trial and error, there are some important realisations that I’d like to share – all about how I believe my disabilities make me a better parent. For starters, I’m resourceful and resilient, which is easily the one that other people notice the most. This means that I can do a lot with very little, and I’m great at problem-solving because I’ve simply had no choice. The reason I freelance as a writer is precisely this. It’s a rare job that can be done from home, flexibly, with only a laptop and the internet, and without the unsustainable pressure that shift work would put on my body. This has helped me as a mum greatly, as I can get work done before she even wakes up. Secondly, I’ve built up gratitude over the years, especially as most of the fears my medical team had for my parenting journey haven’t come to pass. This gratefulness really enables me to push through the days where everything seems to be going wrong – the days where Dalia is in a foul mood, refuses to stick to her sleep schedule, eat her meals or stop crying. The days where teething feels like a black hole we’ll never escape from. I remind myself how hard fought-for these moments really were and how I never thought I’d have the honour of struggling through them. Then there’s patience. This third skill means that if I don’t pace myself while doing even the most mundane of daily tasks, there are huge consequences – such as drastically increased pain and fatigue, migraines, and burnouts that can render me incapacitated for weeks sometimes. Patience and restraint has made me much more able to deal with toddler meltdowns and chaotic sleep schedules. Self-confidence and self-worth combined are the fourth skills that make me a better mum. My disabilities have rendered me bed bound for huge swathes of my life, and this surplus of time and lack of stimulation has made me ruminate so much, scrutinising every aspect of myself, tearing down and rebuilding them time and time again. My self-worth used to be so tied to my productivity and independence, and I’ve had to reframe this entirely as they both slipped. Years of fighting back against negative self-talk will prove invaluable once my child is old enough to start grappling with these concepts herself. And lastly, there’s my budgeting skills. Disability is very expensive and benefits are very low – I get roughly the same amount as a student loan each year (around £550 a month) – in disability benefit PIP and live purely on this and when I’m unable to write. Tim only works part-time and so helps with bills, but his budget doesn’t go much further either. This has made me very good at stretching a budget well beyond what is typically considered reasonable. Let’s be clear, I’m not saying these skills are unique to disabled people – or apply to all of us – but disability has definitely heightened them for me personally. People without first-hand experience often don’t realise how much skill navigating disability actually requires – and that’s before factoring in things like relentless medical advocacy (advocating for yourself in medical settings, especially when doctors are reluctant to treat you or accept that you require further help) or the complex, often brutal workings of our benefits system. In fact, often people seem surprised that I wanted children at all due to my health issues or that I’d be too scared of passing my genes on. These assumptions of childlessness even extended to some of my doctors.

Having a baby as a disabled woman has been the most rewarding, humbling and hardest thing I’ve ever done. As cliche as it sounds, I’m still learning so much more every day. But I’ve never felt this thankful for or proud of my disabilities and what they’ve taught me over the years. That’s why I’m choosing to see those five key things as what makes me the best mum I can be. Do you have a story you’d like to share? Get in touch by emailing jess.austin@metro.co.uk.

I asked my partner to plan a date night – his idea of romance left me shocked,Hannah Wilkinson,"Oct 26, 2024, 12:00pm",,"Home,Lifestyle","‘You’re never going to guess what I’ve got planned for tonight,’ my partner, Bren, told me, grinning like a Cheshire cat. It was July 2024, and he had been teasing me with this statement for weeks. Each time I’d hazard a guess but would get no closer to deciphering the surprise. I started to imagine the unthinkable: that he’d signed me up for a Tough Mudder. Or, like that poor woman on Don’t Tell the Bride, he’d booked a skydive and bungee jump before we declared our love to one another. At the start of the year, I suggested we reinstate weekly date nights because food-shopping trips to Lidl had become our only recurring outing. Having experienced several relationships that ended due to a lack of romance, I wanted to ensure we kept the same flame burning that had been ignited on a sticky dance floor in a Soho salsa club over a year ago. He agreed and we’ve since taken turns to plan new dating experiences – some surprises, and some mutually organised. We’ve enjoyed late-night Japanese dinners and at-home movie marathons, with highlights including a sunset picnic on a scenic clifftop and a spa night away. But all of these memories were about to be trumped. ‘What do I need to wear tonight?’ I asked that night while throwing back a Paracetamol – still recovering from a week-long cold.

TONIGHT: THE OGRETONES. THE UK’S #1 SHREK TRIBUTE BAND. My mouth was agape. I was as shocked as I was when I learned Pinocchio had a penchant for wearing ladies’ underwear. I’d never heard of a tribute band that specialised in the back catalogue of the greatest movie franchise of all time. With the amount of medicine in my system I questioned if this could all be a fever dream – I reached out to touch the poster just as a man walked past wearing protruding green ears. Nope. This was real life. I’ve always used Shrek as an emotional support tool. Whether sick, sad or overwhelmed by the choice of what to watch on Netflix, I’ll stick Shrek on knowing that for the next hour and a half, all of my troubles are but a distant memory. Perhaps it’s childhood nostalgia, the perfect casting, innuendo-laden humour – or a combination of all those things that keeps me returning for more. My partner learned of my love for Shrek early in our relationship when we spent a weekend watching each other’s favourite films. He embraced Shrek as much as his beloved Back to the Future franchise, so he was just as excited as me to find out what tonight’s event had in store. We headed straight to the bar where an ‘Ogretini’ was the beverage du jour, but having not drunk Midori since I was a sixteen-year-old stealing spirits from parent’s cupboards, we kept it safe and settled on a Guinness. Drinks in hand, we took our place towards the front of the stage alongside fellow millennials who looked just as bewildered by what could be in store for us. But all nerves dissipated once the band made their way to the stage. Three method-acting Blind Mice and a Big Bad Wolf wearing grandma’s nightie took their place alongside their fellow fairytale characters to unleash Smash Mouth’s All Star. ‘This is the best night ever,’ I laughed. ‘I can’t believe you found this!’ I said as we frolicked along to an awe-inspiring rendition of Live and Let Die. As suprise date nights go… this was up there with the best of them. @The Ogretones  #shrekisloveshrekislife #millenialsontiktok #datenightidea An electric set list and two encores later, we arrived home with hoarse voices from all the singing but with our hearts very much full. The morning after our date, I posted a b-roll of the evening to TikTok intending to give friends and family a giggle. I didn’t expect to open my phone a few hours later and see that over 100,000 people had watched it. I fell in love after 15 minutes and he hadn't said a word My daughter got caught in a hailstorm and it changed her forever ‘Talk dirty to me,’ I said - then my lover went quiet There's a phrase that people hate even more than 'live, laugh, love' As the week went on, we watched in astonishment as the video slowly started to creep to over one and a half million views, with comments like: ‘Shrek is love, Shrek is life,’. ‘Ideal dream date, never leave this man!!’ and ‘This is brilliant! Book them for your future wedding.’ I never thought we’d be the kind of couple to open our relationship up, but I’m pleased to report that a night with a green ogre and his band of enchanted misfits has helped keep the romance well and truly alive. We’ve long found that relationships require thoughtfulness, fun, and a willingness to embrace the unexpected. Since that night, we’ve committed to prioritising each other more than ever – and in my eyes, that’ll do Donkey, that’ll do.

How I ended up on a weekend break in a warzone… and why I’d love to go back,Angela Kennedy,"Oct 26, 2024, 10:00am",,"Home,News,World","Standing in the centre of the city, I felt the buzz of this beautiful old cosmopolitan hub. Bustling cafes, fine restaurants, grand hotels, chic bars and boutiques. Locals exuded enviable street-style cool. Was I in Prague, Paris, Barcelona? No, I was on a weekend break in L’viv, Ukraine – a nation experiencing the bombs and bullets of a brutal invasion. It began, as many crazy ideas do, with an invitation from a total stranger on social media. Ukrainian journalist, Maria Romanenko, tweeted a shout-out to join a trip to L’viv. I was tempted. Part of my family is from L’viv region – so I wanted to make a personal journey to my grandfather’s birthplace. But that was out of the question with the full-scale invasion by Russia. Now, with the safety-cushion of a group and the help of a native speaker, it seemed like a possibility. Of course, a holiday in a warzone wasn’t the most sensible idea I’d ever had. The UK government advises against all but essential travel to western parts of Ukraine, including L’viv. But the decision was made and the countdown was on. I didn’t tell my parents for fear they’d worry. Added to the aptly named, L’viving La Vida Loca, WhatsApp group, I contacted my fellow travellers. A lovely, lively bunch. Nine of us were travelling from the UK, four women and five men from very different backgrounds, aged from twenties to fifties. We prepared by downloading air raid alarm apps onto our phones, as advised by Maria’s partner, Jez – the mastermind behind our travel logistics. A sobering reminder we’d be in a country under attack. The mood lightened when group member Phil posted: “Downloaded the air raid app yesterday and it made me incredibly popular at home when it went off at 3am last night!” Gearing up to go, I booked my flight to Poland. I packed a mini-portable powerbank for phone charging to keep in touch with the group. Sadly, power cuts are frequent as Russia bombs energy infrastructure to make daily life difficult for civilians. Excitement was growing – but on September 4, ten days before departure, Russia bombed L’viv, destroying residential buildings with missiles. Seven people were killed and 66 wounded. Heartbreakingly, mother Eugenia, 43 and her daughters Yaryna, 21, Daryna, 18, and Emilia, 7, were killed. Father, Yaroslav, narrowly survived – his family annihilated in one terrible moment. Shock, anger and disgust rattled around our group at these senseless murders of innocents. Another emotion was fear. What on earth were we doing? One person dropped out, but happily soon rejoined after calming his family’s understandable fears. I briefly considered not going. But it was unlikely another attack would happen so soon in this region hundreds of kilometres from the frontlines. In a weird way I felt even more determined to show my support by visiting. On a chilly September morning, my husband and I bundled ourselves into a 5am taxi to Stansted airport. Maria and Jez’s tried and tested route is flying to Rzeszów in Poland, then taking the Lev bus directly to L’viv. We met Phil in the airport café. The rest of our group were on the Manchester flight. Meeting the group was a buzz. I was surprised by how fast and efficient the bus border crossing was – we may have been lucky. The Ukrainian border guard looked delighted and amused at us Brits on a sightseeing trip to Ukraine. Crossing the border, a bundle of Ukrainian flags intermixed with EU flags fluttered in the breeze – symbol of future hope. Arriving, we split to settle into our hotels – many now with air raid shelters. I stayed at the centrally located George Hotel, a gorgeous old building with a pink and white Art Nouveau-style façade. Standing on our amazingly long private balcony overlooking downtown L’viv, solemn music began playing outside. I saw a procession of black cars with people stopping to show respect. A funeral procession for three fallen defenders had been held that day, I later discovered. In the evening, we were going for dinner at Choven, a gastro-pub with a sprawling range of craft beers. But the place was rammed, so we couldn’t get a table. It was heartening to see Ukrainians trying to live as normally as possible despite the horrors of invasion, just as Brits did during the Blitz. Instead, we went to Chiberechna, a Crimean Tatar restaurant specialising in chebureki savoury fried pancakes filled with meat, veggies or cheese. I opted for the yantiq pancakes – grilled instead of fried – stuffed with lamb, onion, coriander. Delicious! A post shared by Чіберечна від Селям (@chiberechna) Sipping on a glass of Odesa Black – a rich cherry, chocolatey red wine – I chatted to Anca, a Romanian citizen who joined us for dinner. Fresh from finishing a Master’s Degree at Liverpool University, she was spending five weeks at L’viv Volunteer Kitchen helping peel, slice and dehydrate vegetables for meals for frontline soldiers. She also volunteered to weave nets to protect troops in the trenches. Anca pointed out that safety is relative, saying: ‘As a woman, I feel safer in L’viv than in parts of London or Liverpool. There are many risks [in life] some closer to home.’ I couldn’t agree more. Three men in military uniform were eating heartily and drinking shots, with Ukrainian cheers of ‘budmo!’ Everyone fell silent as the tough-looking men belted out an uplifting song in perfect three-part harmony! Diners applauded as the waitress brought a birthday cake for one of them. I wondered who those men were before the invasion began – and whether they would survive. Our group dispersed at 11.30pm, exhausted from travelling but that wasn’t the reason. L’viv has a curfew due to the Russian invasion. In L’viv, it’s 12am until 5am. Everybody must be off the streets. We hurried through the rapidly emptying city – distracted by brightly lit boutique window displays of handmade jewellery, bags and clothes. I was nervous on the first night – expecting an air raid siren. We had warm clothes and documents ready to flee to a shelter. Thankfully, we didn’t need them. As morning rain turned to sunshine, we gathered for a walking tour, led by L’viv local, Diana, who showed us an array of amazing sights including awe-inspiring churches, one with Christening guests wearing traditional vyshyvanka embroidered shirts. We saw captivating street art, the fascinating Armenian quarter, and rows of beautiful old buildings – from Art Nouveau and Art deco to Gothic flourishes – some obscured by sandbags and scaffolding to protect from bomb blasts. A trumpeter belted out a patriotic tune from the balcony of a government building. Outside the Dzyga Arts Centre, we met brightly dressed couple Alex and Nathalia. Alex said he was a hippy in L’viv when it was part of the USSR – his lifestyle frowned on by anti-western authorities. He loved listening to bands such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin, even though he couldn’t understand the words. We finished at the spectacular L’viv opera house. People were queuing to register for the Sunday morning run around the city – a bit like Parkrun. Maria was taking part too. As the group headed for lunch at Cantona Pub – a Manchester United-themed bar, I set off on a mission of my own. To my grandfather’s village of Zvenyhorod. An impressive golden-domed church stood on the outskirts. Further on, a public square with a stream and monumental Viking-like statues, created in the Eighties to mark the village’s 900th anniversary. A statue of Ukrainian national poet, Taras Shevchenko, stood outside the museum. I found Shevchenko poems among my grandfather’s most treasured possessions. Inside the museum the ladies on the front desk were delightful. I’d brought flowers to put on the grave of my great-grandmother but didn’t know where to search. So, I presented them to the lovely museum ladies. I’d sent a Google-translated DM to Zvenyhorod Facebook page before our visit. But I didn’t hear back. However, when I showed the message, the women excitedly brandished their own printed copy – I was amazed. Unfortunately, I couldn’t speak Ukrainian, so we couldn’t communicate. The museum was full of fascinating local artefacts such as jewellery, traditional embroideries and stained-glass windows. Virtual reality tech allows you to ‘walk around’ old Zvenyhorod, which was once a grand principality – I’d love to try it next time. The ever-helpful ladies collared two English-speaking Ukrainians. They told me the town archivist was searching for my family. I was moved they went to such trouble for a stranger. I thanked them and bought items from their shop – a lovely hand-embroidered bag. I wanted to explore further, but our taxi was waiting. Hopping over to the next village for Gryniv Music Festival, rain began pounding down but I felt dizzily elated. Arriving to catch ДикоBrass, a brass funk ensemble so good people were dancing in the pouring rain, we found fellow festival-goers Maria, Ollie and Ash. The rest of our group remained in L’viv for a football match: Shakhtar Donetsk versus Karpaty L’viv. We stayed dry under large awnings, watching NAZVA, a young folky-poppy duo, but the final act blew us away. As if by magic, rain stopped and all-female folk-rock band, Yagody, stole our souls for an hour – there was something electric in the atmosphere. On our final day, we visited Unbroken, a rehabilitation centre for victims of Russian violence, such as bomb blast injuries. More than 15,000 Ukrainians, including 2,000 children, have been treated there, says its website. Unbroken offers reconstructive surgery, orthopaedics, prosthetics, physical and psychological rehabilitation. Communications director, Julie, showed us around with passion and enthusiasm that was contagious. We met amputee soldier, Artem, whose mental strength was humbling. ‘No matter what they [Russians] do, we will keep coming back,’ he said. We met Vadim, a Marine, recuperating but keen to return to the frontlines. Finding out we were British, Artem quipped: ‘Say hello to Prince Harry for me!’ Seeing rehabilitation rooms for children who’d lost limbs in Russian bombings was incredibly sad. We met a severely injured man in his hospital bed who told us of horrific experiences. But far from sad stories this was the testimony of survivors, each determined to have a fulfilling future. Moment Putin is left absolutely seething at BBC reporter over question about Ukraine Astronaut returns from space with mystery medical condition Inside the radioactive island with mutant sharks that was used to test nuclear bombs Man suffering from indigestion finds out it's something more sinister Unbroken needs funding for equipment – you can donate. As Maria said: ‘Ukrainian soldiers have given up their lives, limbs, careers and family life to protect us all. We must ensure Ukraine wins soon. But it’s not just about Ukraine – it’s about future peace for the world.’ Returning to the city, I walked to Ivan Franko National University of Lviv, where my grandfather was once a student. Soldiers sat on benches talking animatedly, while old men played board games. By Taras Shevchenko statue, a group of older people gathered to sing. A man in military uniform hoisted a delighted little boy on his shoulders. That night, our farewell dinner was at the achingly cool Cloud no. 7 Panorama with rooftop bar, before catching the train from L’viv to Przemyśl in Poland. The train is a quicker route back than the coach. The crossing was smooth and efficient. Soon we were on our flight home – which had Ukrainian football hero Andriy Shevchenko on board! The following morning, my air raid siren app went off. L’viv was under threat. I thought about all the people I’d seen there and hoped they would be safe.

Met Office gives verdict on if it will snow this week,Gethin Hicks and Danny Rigg,"Oct 26, 2024, 9:08am","Oct 26, 2024, 9:38am","Home,News,UK","Some of Britain could see snow as early as next week, according to the Met Office’s long range forecast. Snow does not usually fall in the United Kingdom until the turn of the year, but it could come early this year. Temperatures are predicted to plummet to freezing in the coming weeks, with the possibility of snowfall in the next few days. So just where is snow expected to fall in the UK across the coming days? Don’t get too excited for a snow fight just yet, as it’s going to be limited to areas like Inverness in the north and east of Scotland. That’s if there’s any snow at all, which may be hard to imagine after temperatures up to the high teens in parts of the UK this week. From October 30 to November 8, the Met Office predicts: ‘The period is likely to be characterised by often quiet and settled weather, as an area of high pressure becomes the dominant feature of the weather. ‘Some mist and fog is probable in the south at first, alongside rather cloudy conditions, whilst in the extreme north spells of stronger winds and rain could brush past giving a slightly more unsettled picture. ‘Into the start of November, there is a chance the weather could (briefly) turn much colder/brighter, with a chance of snow showers in northern and eastern areas, but it’s equally possible these could stay clear of the UK, or the milder conditions could remain in place.

But the Met Office warned ‘headlines don’t always reflect the reality’. Clarifying the snow forecast, it said: ‘Any snow will likely be confined to high ground in the north, as is normal for the time of year.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

Championship match put on hold as mystery individual is spotted flying over stadium,Tom Olver,"Oct 26, 2024, 3:12pm","Oct 26, 2024, 3:31pm","Home,Sport,Football","Coventry City’s clash with Luton Town was temporarily put on hold after an individual was spotted flying over the stadium in the closing stages of the thrilling Championship clash. Haji Wright scrambled home a last-gasp winner as Mark Robins’ hosts came from two goals down to secure a 3-2 victory but a paragliding daredevil briefly took centre stage in the West Midlands. Loud cheers and whistles were heard around the stadium as the person in question hovered over the pitch with around ten minutes remaining of normal time at the Coventry Building Society Arena. The match had to be paused as the mystery individual drifted over the stands and out of the view from Sky Sports’ cameras, before referee Bobby Madley blew his whistle to signal for play to be resumed. Coventry had picked up just two wins prior to their victory over Luton and the result ensured Robins’ men leapfrogged their visitors into 19th place in the table. Luton, meanwhile, find themselves stranded down in 19th place following the defeat and could be sucked into the drop zone should results go against them this weekend. Rob Edwards’ side have accumulated just 12 points in the division after suffering relegation from the Premier League last season. Dude casually flying over the match between Coventry vs Luton FC #covlut pic.twitter.com/do0QlzVwmo ‘I don’t really care how they come as long as they go in,’ Coventry forward Wright told Sky Sports when asked about his scruffy winning goal. ‘It was an important goal for us, we were working throughout the 90 minutes to get a goal like this and for it to happen this way is amazing. ‘I think our play in the first half gave us a bit of confidence. ‘We knew we were creating chances and it was just a matter of time before we took one.’ After a tough start to the 2024/25 campaign, Wright is confident Coventry are beginning to ‘gel’ and find their feet. ‘It’s frustrating. We still have loads of new players and our team is quite young so we’re still trying to find that gel and the perfect tempo to play with,’ he added. ‘We’re still finding our feet a bit but today was a great day for us.’ How Arsenal academy stars reacted to Jack Wilshere's Norwich departure Former Premier League footballer, 24, arrested over rape of woman in London hotel Sheffield United pay moving tribute to former player George Baldock before Leeds clash Chris Wilder 'stunned and numb' after tragic death of footballer George Baldock A downbeat Edwards criticised Luton’s poor defending in the match but took full responsibility for the manner of his team’s loss. ‘There were too many moments where we were open, gave them that glimmer from a set-piece. It’s on us, it’s on me,’ the Luton head coach said shortly after the final whistle. ‘It’s 2-1 and then the crowd really get behind them, more intensity. We tried to introduce changes early to have an impact but in the end we haven’t defended well enough. ‘I’ll completely own it. You can’t be 2-0 up and then lose the game 3-2.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
