Israel launched strikes on Iran in a retaliatory attack. Here’s what we know,"Helen Regan,CNN","7:16 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",5 minute,"World,Middle East","Israel said on Saturday it had struck military targets inside Iran in response to earlier Iranian attacks, again raising fears that the long-running confrontation between the two powerful militaries could escalate into an all-out regional war that draws in the United States. The Israeli military said it had targeted Iranian missile manufacturing sites and aerial defense systems in what appeared to be a highly calculated response that avoided critical energy infrastructure, such as oil fields and nuclear facilities. Calling the strikes a “clear violation” of international law, Iran’s foreign ministry said in a statement that it “considers itself entitled and obligated to defend itself.” But Iran also appeared to downplay the impact, claiming its air defenses had successfully countered the strikes in three provinces – Tehran, Ilam and Khuzestan – and that the damage was “limited.” The Iranian army said Saturday morning that two soldiers were killed in the strikes, without clarifying where the deaths happened. The Iranian soldiers died “confronting the projectiles of the criminal Zionist entity,” a reference to Israel, the army said in a statement, which was published on state media. The US meanwhile described the attack as “an exercise in self-defense” that “specifically avoided populated areas and focused solely on military targets.” Israel had vowed Iran would pay for its large-scale missile attack on October 1 that saw around 200 missiles fired at Israel, forcing people across the country to take cover in bomb shelters. For weeks Israeli leaders have been deliberating on the nature and scope of such a response. Here’s what we know. In the early hours of Saturday local time, Israel launched direct airstrikes against Iran, conducting what it said was “precise strikes on military targets.” The Israeli military said its air force struck “missile manufacturing facilities” that it said were used to produce the missiles that Iran had fired at Israel over the last year. It also said the Israeli military struck “surface-to-air missile arrays and additional Iranian aerial capabilities, that were intended to restrict Israel’s aerial freedom of operation in Iran.” It is unclear if those manufacturing facilities also produced missiles launched by Iranian proxies Hezbollah, Hamas and Houthi rebels in Yemen. Iran later confirmed the attack but said the strikes caused only “limited damage” in some areas, while images broadcast on state media showed the calmness on the streets of the capital Tehran. Iran’s state news agency reported strikes targeting “military centers in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam” had been “successfully intercepted.” Several explosions were heard west of Tehran around 2:15 a.m. local time (7 p.m. ET Friday), according to the state news agency. Iranian officials said blasts heard around the country were related to air defense systems being deployed. The initial strikes were closely followed by a second wave, as video posted to social media by Tehran residents showed tracer fire and explosions illuminating the Iranian capital’s sky as dawn neared. A third and final wave then followed. By about 6 a.m. local time, the Israeli military said it has concluded its operation, saying the “mission was fulfilled” and Israeli jets “have safely returned home.” Saturday’s strikes are part of Israel’s long-awaited retaliation to Iran’s missile attack earlier this month, as the ongoing war in the Middle East continues to escalate to dangerous new levels. On October 1, Iran launched 200 projectiles towards Tel Aviv and Israeli military bases in what it said was a response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others, its largest ever such attack. That missile barrage came about 24 hours after Israel launched a ground war in Lebanon, opening a new front in its war against Iranian-backed militants. Israel and Iran have been fighting a shadow war through proxies and covert actions for decades. In April, that war came out into the open when Iran launched a wave of drones and missiles at Israel in an unprecedented attack in response to a suspected Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria.

      Iran engages in urgent diplomacy as it braces for Israel’s response to missile attacks In recent weeks, Israel has ramped up its attacks against Iran’s proxies, including launching strikes targeting the Houthis in Yemen, and militants in Syria. But it’s in Lebanon where Israel has refocused its operations after tit-for-tat strikes across the border escalated after Israel eliminated the leadership of Iran-backed Hezbollah in series of assassinations and airstrikes. Hezbollah leader Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli strike on his underground headquarters in Beirut in September. Netanyahu had previously said his killing was “a necessary step” toward changing “the balance of power in the region for years to come.” Israel’s war in Lebanon has since killed more than 2,500 people, displaced 1.2 million and created a unprecedented humanitarian crisis, according to Lebanon’s leader and international health officials. In a statement issued at the outset of Saturday’s actions, the Israeli military accused Iran and its regional proxies of relentlessly attacking Israel beginning with last year’s 7 October attack by Iran-allied Hamas, during which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and another 250 abducted. Following the October 7 attacks, Israel declared war on Hamas and launched military operations in Gaza that have killed more than 42,000 people. The UN’s human rights chief warned Friday that “one of the darkest moments” of the war is unfolding in the north of Gaza where the Israeli military is “subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and starvation.” A major concern of increasing military escalations is that Israel and Iran will become entangled in a full-scale war, one that risks drawing the US – Israel’s closest ally and biggest weapons supplier – into the fray. A senior US administration official said President Biden has “encouraged” Netanyahu last week to “design” a retaliatory attack that would “deter future attacks against Israel.” In recent weeks, the US and other allies have urged Netanyahu to exercise restraint and avoid striking Iran’s nuclear and oil assets. The US’ Gulf allies, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar, expressed similar concerns as an attack on Iranian oil facilities could create negative economic and environmental impacts for the entire region, an Arab diplomat told CNN. The White House said the US “was not a participant in this operation” and urged “Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation.” By refraining from attacking Iran’s oil or nuclear sites, Israel has potentially left room for de-escalation. But it is unclear whether Iran will respond to this latest attack. Israel’s top military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said after the conclusion of strikes that if Iran were to begin “a new round of escalation,” Israel will be “obligated to respond.” CNN’s Mostafa Salem, Eyad Kourdi, Alex Marquardt, Jeremy Diamond, Lauren Izso, Artemis Moshtaghian, Eugenia Yosef, Matthew Chance, Nechirvan Mando, Zeena Saifi, Alex Stambaugh, Samantha Waldenberg, Kayla Tausche, Paul P.

Georgia’s pro-Western president condemns ‘troubling incidents of violence’ at polling stations with crucial vote underway,"Christian Edwards,Niamh Kennedy,CNN","11:37 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",3 minute,"World,Europe","Georgia’s President Salome Zourabichvili has condemned “deeply troubling incidents of violence unfolding at various polling stations” as the country votes in a crucial parliamentary election. Voting opened early Saturday in the election, seen as a stark choice between Russia and the West. The ruling Georgian Dream party, which has in recent years taken a sharp authoritarian turn and stalled the country’s progress toward potential European Union membership, is bidding for re-election. Activist and monitoring groups shared footage that they said showed ballot stuffing at a polling station in Marneuli, southern Georgia. Another video showed a man, identified in local media as Azad Karimov – head of the opposition United National Movement (UNM) party’s regional organization – being assaulted by several men outside the polling station in Marneuli’s 69th precinct. Photos showed Karimov with a bloody nose and cuts to his face. Related article
      As Georgia votes, fears of a stolen election and a return to the Kremlin’s orbit loom large Voting has been suspended at that polling station and its results have declared invalid, the country’s Central Election Commission told CNN. In an emergency briefing, the head of the CEC called on Marneuli’s election officials to investigate the incident and take appropriate action. “This is troubling information, and the election administration, if confirmed, will not allow such isolated, controlled, or manipulative incidents to undermine the many months of efforts we have put forth into the election day,” Giorgi Kalandarishvili said. Zourabichvili, a pro-Western figure whose powers are largely ceremonial, said she had been unable to reach the minister of internal affairs and that “the official government lines are not working.” Before the election, Zourabichvili urged Georgians to vote against Georgian Dream. “In some cases, media equipment has been destroyed, and direct acts of violence have occurred. Groups have gathered with the sole purpose of provoking conflict and confrontation,” Zourabichvili said in a statement shared with CNN. “It reflects weakness, and I urge everyone not to be intimidated by it.” Responding to the reports from Marneuli, Georgian Dream politician Givi Mikanadze said “anyone who hinders the election process” will be punished, but appeared to blame the opposition for the incident. “The opposition has no tangible factor other than to stage provocations, because they know that they will lose the elections,” he said, according to Imedia Media, a Georgian outlet. After casting his ballot early Saturday, Georgia’s Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze told reporters that Georgian Dream will secure 60% of the vote and called on opposition parties to recognize these results. Government critics have questioned how Kobakhidze could know the results in advance. The CEC reported voter turnout at 50.6% at 5 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET), which Zourabichvili said was “very high.” At 10 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), the CEC will announce preliminary results based on 90% of votes counted."
Russian strike on Ukrainian hospital used to treat soldiers kills at least five,"Niamh Kennedy,Maria Kostenko,CNN","10:18 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",3 minute,"World,Europe","Russia struck a major Ukrainian hospital used to treat injured soldiers, killing at least five people, Ukrainian officials said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the Mechnikov Hospital in the south-central city of Dnipro one of the country’s “most important.” Before the war it treated up to 40,000 patients a year. Five people, including a child, were killed in the strikes overnight, said Serhii Lysak, head of the Dnipro regional military administration, posting on his official Telegram. The strike comes just days after Russian President Vladimir Putin faced calls from world leaders attending the BRICs summit in Kazan, Russia to end the war in Ukraine. Zelensky made a pointed reference to this week’s summit in his statement posted on social media, saying that “after everything said in Kazan, Russian murderers have resumed their usual business.” “This proves once again that aggression cannot be stopped by words alone but only by decisive action in defense of the state and the people against whom this war is waged,” the Ukrainian leader added.

      ‘What the f**k to do with them?’ Russian soldiers heard condemning North Korean recruits in intercepted audio At least 21 people were injured in the attack on Dnipro including a 17-year-old boy who is in a “serious condition,” according to Lysak. “As a result of the overnight missile attack, there is damage in several locations in the city,” Lysak said, adding that one apartment building had been destroyed and two dozen others damaged by the strike. Photos shared by Lysak showed rescuers working through huge piles of rubble and the inside of what looked to be a hospital room with blown out windows. The city’s mayor, Borys Filatov described a sleepless night he spent as missiles descended upon the city. “This is not just a two-story building;. This is an ordinary residential building with eight apartments hit with a ballistic missile,” Filatov added. Dnipro was not the only major Ukrainian city hit overnight. The capital, Kyiv also experienced a drone attack, according to the head of the military administration, Serhii Popko. A young girl was killed after her apartment building in the Solomianskyi district was struck, Popko said. A woman in her 50s was also killed by strikes in the Kyiv region, according to the regional military administration. More than 100 people were evacuated from the same residential building in the city after what Popko said was the sixteenth air attack on Kyiv this month alone. The Ukrainian Air Force said Russia used a combination of “various types of missiles, Shahed-type attack UAVs, and drones of unspecified type” to carry out attacks across the country. Ukrainian air defenses succeeded in shooting down 44 out of 91 Russian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the Air Force said on Telegram. Three Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles launched by Crimea were also detected, according to the air force."
Can New York Yankees recover from last-gasp World Series Game 1 loss against Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 2?,"Issy Ronald,CNN","9:45 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",4 minute,,"Just one game in and this World Series has already produced another classic installment in the long, storied rivalry between the New York Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers. It seemed impossible that this series could live up to the frenzied anticipation that had dominated the build-up or become another memorable chapter in the 83-year-old rivalry these two teams share in the World Series alone.

      Bridegrooms and Bums: How the Dodgers went from Brooklyn’s darling to Los Angeles’ colossus But, with one swing of the bat on Friday, Freddie Freeman ensured that Game 1 did so, hitting the first ever walk-off grand slam in a World Series with his Dodgers trailing 3-2 at the bottom of the 10th inning and down to their last out. He jogged around the bases as Dodger Stadium erupted in delirium, celebrating their team somehow stealing a 6-3 Game 1 win. Now, just a day later, the Yankees must regroup from their last-gasp loss for Game 2 on Saturday evening as they face the Dodgers on the LA team’s home turf once again. For the Dodgers, Game 2 marks a golden opportunity to stamp their authority on the series while they are filled with confidence before they travel to New York for the next two games at least. “To come out 1-0 is a huge start,” said Freeman after the game. The Dodgers are now three wins away from a World Series triumph and, historically, the teams who have won Game 1 have gone onto win the series 121 of 191 times (65%) of the time. Since 1995, that increases to 23 of 29 times (79%) and in the current 2-3-2 format, teams who have won Game 1 at home have gone on to take the series 68 of 101 times (67%). But the Yankees are still remaining positive ahead of Game 2. “We played that team really well for the whole entire game,” Yankees left fielder Alex Verdugo said after their loss, per MLB.com. “At the end of the day, we’re the two best teams out here, so we’re going to come here with our heads held up high, with confidence, and go out here and compete again.” Related article
      Los Angeles Dodgers’ Freddie Freeman launches himself into history with dramatic grand slam to win Game 1 of the World Series Both teams are stacked full of star talent and the Yankees can rely on the likes of Aaron Judge, Juan Soto and Giancarlo Stanton to pull off the impossible, like Freeman did for the Dodgers. The way in which the Yankees utilize their bullpen will be heavily scrutinized in Game 2 as well after manager Aaron Boone’s decision for Nestor Cortes to pitch in the bottom of the 10th inning. Cortes hadn’t pitched since September 18 after suffering a left elbow flexor strain, but was brought in to challenge the Dodgers’ left-handed pair of Ohtani and Freeman. “If I wasn’t ready enough and I wasn’t healthy enough, I would not have done it. And they wouldn’t have allowed me,” Cortes said after the game, per MLB.com. “So I think we’re in a good spot. I’ll get another opportunity. We’ve got to win four games in this Series. It was right there on our fingertips, but we’re going to come back tomorrow strong.” Carlos Rodón will start on the mound for the Yankees in Game 2, hoping to stifle the Dodgers’ offense, while Yoshinobu Yamamoto will be hoping to replicate his dominant pitching performance in June against the Yankees. Every one of the best-of-seven series games will be broadcast on Fox in the US, with each contest starting at 8:08 p.m. ET. The schedule is as follows: Game 2: Saturday, October 26 – New York Yankees at Los Angeles Dodgers from Dodger Stadium, 8:08 p.m. ET Game 3: Monday, October 28 – Los Angeles Dodgers at New York Yankees from Yankee Stadium, 8:08 p.m. ET Game 4: Tuesday, October 29 – Los Angeles Dodgers at New York Yankees from Yankee Stadium, 8:08 p.m. ET Game 5*: Wednesday, October 30 – Los Angeles Dodgers at New York Yankees from Yankee Stadium, 8:08 p.m. ET Game 6*: Friday, November 1 – New York Yankees at Los Angeles Dodgers from Dodger Stadium, 8:08 p.m. ET Game 7*: Saturday, November 2 – New York Yankees at Los Angeles Dodgers from Dodger Stadium, 8:08 p.m. ET *if necessary"

"The rape claims that tie the Menendez case to Menudo: ‘There might be other victims,’ doc producer says","Jason Kravarik,Elizabeth Wagmeister,CNN","5:30 PM EDT, Fri October 25, 2024",3 minute,,"Erik and Lyle Menendez have always maintained that they killed their parents because they were being sexually abused by their father. New evidence that may support the Menendez brothers’ allegations - some brought to light in a Peacock docuseries last year - could soon lead to the men leaving prison. The brothers have been serving life sentences for fatally shooting Jose and Kitty Menendez in the family’s California mansion in 1989. Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón announced this week that he is seeking resentencing, citing a letter allegedly written by Erik to his cousin before the murders in which he referenced being afraid of his father and sworn testimony from Roy Rosselló, a former member of the boy band Menudo, who claims he was raped by Jose – then the head of RCA Records – in the mid-’80s. Rosselló first publicly shared his account in “Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed” in 2023, which prompted calls to reexamine the Menendez brothers’ sentences in light of their abuse claims. “No other young man has ever come forward and said that he was raped by Jose Menendez,” Robert Rand,  a journalist who co-produced the docuseries, told CNN. “We believe that there might be other victims out there and we are hoping that they’ll contact us.” Rand’s project, a recent Netflix documentary and the series “Monsters: The Lyle and Eric Menendez Story,” all illustrate continued interest in the Menendez case and suggest an evolving societal understanding of sexual abuse, especially for male victims, Rand said. Rosselló recalled in “Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed” that he was 13 years old when he met Jose Menendez. “That’s the man here, that raped me. This guy, that’s the pedophile,” Rosselló said in docuseries as he pointed to a photo of Jose Menendez. He claims he was given wine and passed out before he later woke up in a New York City hotel room and found himself bleeding. “I was in terrible pain for a week. I could barely stand the pain. I couldn’t even move,” Rosselló said tearfully. The Menendez brothers’ habeas corpus petition, filed shortly after the docuseries released, cites Rosselló’s allegations. “Jurors never knew that Jose Menendez raped Rosselló a second time in a New York City hotel,” the filing states. “Some of the Menendez supporters were saying, ‘Well, where was Roy Rosselló 30 years ago when the brothers were on trial?” Rand told CNN. “But you have to understand that some people are so ashamed of being abuse survivors, they take that secret to their graves.” Rand and the series’ director, Esther Reyes, said Rosselló, who now lives in Brazil, would testify in Los Angeles, if required by the court. “He’s an incredibly credible witness,” Reyes told CNN. “I interviewed him for hours. He’s very consistent. He’s very clear.” CNN reached out to Rosselló regarding Gascón’s recommendation to resentence the Menendez brothers, but he was not available for comment. “Roy is well aware of what’s happening,” Rand said. “Roy is following all the new developments closely.” Rosselló would also like to speak to Erik and Lyle, according to Rand, who added that the brothers’ legal team does not want them to “meet or have any contact because Roy is a potential witness in a capital murder case.” “Roy has told us that he would very much like to meet the Menendez brothers,” Rand said."
"With worst-case scenario averted for now, White House and Harris campaign still face a serious risk in Middle East conflict","Kevin Liptak,CNN","2:39 PM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",6 minute,,"Ten days before the American presidential election, uncontrollable war in the Middle East appears to have been avoided for now, much to the relief of President Joe Biden’s aides at the White House and Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign team in Delaware. “It looks like they didn’t hit anything other than military targets. My hope is this is the end,” Biden said after receiving an update on Israel’s strikes on Iran early Saturday from his intelligence analysts. Such an outcome was hardly a foregone conclusion at the start of this month, when a massive Iranian ballistic missile barrage launched on Israel led to fears of major, escalatory reprisal — potentially targeting Iranian nuclear or oil sites. Still, if in Biden’s mind a worst-case scenario was prevented, the larger knot that is the Middle East conflict remains as firmly gnarled as ever. The direct attack inside Iran brings the region to a new, more dangerous place, with Tehran now mulling its own response to the response. Biden and Harris joined a call Saturday with their national security team and were briefed on the the latest developments in the region according to the White House. “We maintain the importance of supporting Israel’s right to defend itself,” Harris told reporters not long after that briefing, “and we are also very adamant that we must see de-escalation in the region going forward, and that will be our focus.” Asked her message to Iran, Harris said, “We as the United States feel very strongly that Iran must stop what it is doing in terms of this threat that it presents to the region, and we will always defend Israel against any attack by Iran, in that way.” Beyond Iran’s actions, however, the region remains at a boil. Israel continues to expand its operations in Lebanon, which have killed hundreds of women and children and tested American patience — but so far not leading to a major break. And the conflict in Gaza appears no closer to ending than it was before the death this month of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, whose demise Biden hoped would lead to renewed efforts toward a hostages-for-ceasefire deal. That window of opportunity remains cracked, at least in the mind of top Western diplomats, and negotiations will resume this week in Qatar. But few believe there will be any resolution before the November 5 US presidential election, leaving Biden and Harris’ inability to bring stability to the region a serious political liability. That is not where the US was hoping it would be in the immediate lead-up to Election Day, even if full-blown war between Iran and Israel isn’t currently breaking out. American officials don’t believe Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sees much incentive to end his multifront operations before the election. And there is little question in their minds Netanyahu sees former President Donald Trump — whom he has phoned up at multiple points in the weeks preceding Election Day — as a close ally. Campaigning in Michigan on Saturday, Trump brought a group of imams on stage after what he said was a private meeting backstage. “Muslim and Arab voters in Michigan across the country want a stop to endless wars and a return to peace in the Middle East like we had under President Donald J. Trump, have you ever heard of him?” Trump said. “They want strength in the Oval Office, law and order, and common sense.” Speaking Saturday before heading off on what has become a rare campaign trail appearance, Biden declared himself “not surprised” that Trump was in regular contact with Netanyahu. He acknowledged some concern that the Republican nominee was not representing the US in those conversations. For her part, Harris has offered little evidence she would adopt a different approach if elected. Questioned by a voter at CNN’s recent town hall in Pennsylvania about how she would “ensure not another Palestinian dies due to bombs being funded by US tax dollars,” Harris pointed, again, to the nascent ceasefire deal, without saying how she would succeed where Biden has failed. But pressed by CNN’s Anderson Cooper on what she would say to voters who won’t vote for her because of their fury over the administration’s handling of Gaza, she said — essentially — that Trump would just make things worse. “Listen, I am not going to deny the strong feelings that people have. I don’t know that anyone who has seen the images who would not have strong feelings about what has happened,” Harris said. “But I also do know that for many people who care about this issue, they also care about bringing down the price of groceries. They also care about our democracy and not having a president of the United States who admires dictators and is a fascist.” Those answers have done little to convince Arab American voters to throw their support behind Harris, who has given them little to indicate she would not simply act as an extension of the Biden administration on the issue. Abdullah Hammoud, the Democratic mayor of Dearborn, Michigan — a city with one of the highest concentrations of Arab Americans — declined this week to endorse any candidate, encouraging residents instead to “vote your moral conscience.” “I have not found any candidate, especially the candidate with the party I’ve affiliated myself with, who has been willing to depart from the current course that President Biden has taken us down on the genocide in Gaza and the broader conflict that has now touched Lebanon,” he told The Hill in an interview on Wednesday. A trip across the region this week by Secretary of State Antony Blinken yielded little discernible evidence either that Hamas was willing to update its demands for releasing the hostages or that Israel was newly interested in reaching a deal. While a main focus of his attention was planning for a post-war Gaza, the steps to reach that day remain as elusive as ever. For months, Biden has been trying without success to pressure Netanyahu into an agreement that would end the fighting in Gaza, which in his mind would lower temperatures across the region and potentially unlock a wider, transformative normalization across the Middle East. He’s been rebuffed at nearly every turn, leading to enormous frustration and long periods of silence between the two men. That pattern lent a degree of uncertainty to the past weeks, as Biden and his aides sought to discern how Israel would retaliate against Iran’s October 1 ballistic missiles attack. From the start, they signaled a different approach from April, when Israel’s successful interception of Iranian rockets and drones led Biden to encourage Netanyahu to “take the win” and forgo a response. The scale of the ballistic missile barrage made this time different, Biden’s aides said, necessitating action. But in a notably candid string of public comments, the president made clear he opposed strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, and recommended against going after the country’s oil reserves. In a phone call on October 9 — their first in nearly two months — Netanyahu provided reassurance those targets were not in Israel’s sights, despite pressure from some conservatives in his own government to seize a moment of Iranian weakness to go after them. It made for a rare instance over the past year of Biden’s advice being adopted by his Israeli counterpart, even if Netanyahu had his own reasons for avoiding the most sensitive Iranian targets and made clear his country’s decision-making was independent of Washington’s guidance. “It was extensive. It was targeted. It was precise. It was against military targets across Iran. It was in multiple ways, very carefully prepared. And again, I think it was designed to be effective,” a senior US administration official said late Friday. “As far as we’re concerned, that should close out the direct exchange between Israel and Iran,” the official went on. Whether that is what ultimately transpires, of course, is an outcome entirely out of Biden’s hands. This story has been updated with additional reporting. CNN’s Betsy Klein and Samantha Waldenberg contributed to this report."
The US wants this to be ‘the end’ of direct Israel-Iran fire. It may be too soon to tell,"alysis by Nadeen Ebrahim,CNN","1:00 PM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",4 minute,"World,Middle East","After Israel’s attack on Iran Saturday, US officials were quick to caution both countries against perpetuating the cycle of violence, but analysts say lasting de-escalation is not a foregone conclusion. The airstrikes “should be the end of this direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran,” a senior US administration official said after the attacks. After reports emerged of explosions heard in Tehran, Israel in a statement said it launched what it described as “precise strikes on military targets in Iran” early Saturday. The strikes were in response to Iran’s barrage of missiles fired at Israel on October 1, in retaliation to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others.

      Israel strikes Iran in high-stakes retaliation Iran said Israel “attacked parts of military centers” on Saturday in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam, causing “limited damage” in some areas. Iran appeared to have downplayed the Israeli strike, Iranian experts said. State media broadcast images showing calm on the streets of Tehran, with traffic moving and people going about their daily business. Iran’s foreign ministry condemned the attack, calling it “clear violation” of international law. The ministry added that Iran “considers itself entitled and obligated to defend itself” after the Israeli strikes. Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft in Washington, DC, said Iran’s downplayed response may be “more reflective of their desire to de-escalate than a true assessment of the damage Israel inflicted on Iran,” like Israel’s attempts to hide damage caused by Iran’s October 1 attack. Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense for Democracies, also based in DC, said Iran’s downplayed response may be “a strategic move to save face and keep US constraint on Israel.” After several hours of strikes Saturday, the Israeli military said it had targeted manufacturing sites used to produce missiles that Iran has fired at Israel over the past year. Israel also said it hit Iranian aerial defense systems early Saturday to allow its aircraft to attack the other targets. Israel’s decision to strike early Saturday morning came after weeks of deliberations within its security cabinet about the nature and scope of such an attack, Israeli officials said. American officials have been keen to show the extent to which Israel’s attack was restrained and precise, especially as the US pushed Israel not to attack Iran’s energy infrastructure, for fear of igniting a broader conflict, a request Israel seems to have heeded, according to preliminary reports. After Israel’s retaliatory strikes against Iran ended, National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said the White House urges “Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation.” But Israel has not always met the demands of its American ally. Throughout the war, Israel has defied the US’ calls for restraint – on the Rafah operation in southern Gaza, and more recently on a ground war in southern Lebanon. Disagreements between the two governments culminated in an October 13 letter from the US to Israel, demanding the Jewish state act to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza within the next 30 days or risk violating US laws governing foreign military assistance, suggesting US military aid could be in jeopardy. Danny Citrinowicz, a research fellow with the Iran Program at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv and a retired Israel Defense Intelligence officer who specialized in Iran, said it was too early to predict how the coming hours and days will unfold. “But one thing is clear,” he said, “Israel and Iran came closer than ever last night to the brink of direct war.” “The ball is now in the Iranian leadership’s court,” Citrinowicz said on X, adding that the Iranian regime likely faces a familiar dilemma: to strike back for reputational gains, or take Israel’s attack as an end to the direct conflict. Parsi of the Quincy Institute said that “if Iran chooses to exercise restraint… then this chapter may be closed, yet the conflict will remain very much alive.” When Iran chose restraint after Israel’s retaliation in April, it emboldened the Jewish state to take out key Hezbollah leaders in Beirut, which triggered the next cycle of aggression.

      October 25, 2024 Israel strikes Iran in high-stakes retaliation Experts say that while Israel presses on with its wars in Gaza and Lebanon, any pause in direct fighting between Iran and Israel is likely to be short-lived. As long as those regional wars persist, the overall trajectory of the Israel-Iran conflict will escalate. “While we may see some tactical de-escalation, the trajectory remains escalatory,” Parsi said, adding “a new exchange of fire between Israel and Iran will only be a question of time,” with the next round likely to be “more ferocious.” Israel has long tried to push Iran and other Iranian proxies back into deterrence.  But experts say Israel’s strategy may not be entirely effective. “Iran will not be deterred from escalating in the future if it so sees fit, neither would Israel,” H.A. Hellyer, scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies in London, told CNN’s Paula Newton, adding that deterrence is often used as an excuse by the attacking state, but only leads to more regional instability. “It doesn’t de-escalate through escalation,” he said, “which is the most incredible thing I’ve heard.” CNN’s Samantha Waldenberg, Artemis Moshtaghian, Alex Stambaugh, Eugenia Yosef, Jeremy Diamond, Chris Lau and Mostafa Salem contributed reporting."
Israel raids north Gaza hospital as UN warns ‘darkest moment’ is unfolding in the strip,"Abeer Salman,Eyad Kourdi,Kareem Khadder,Tim Lister,Ibrahim Dahman,Nadeen Ebrahim,CNN","12:36 PM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",5 minute,"World,Middle East","Israeli forces have breached a hospital compound in northern Gaza as the United Nations warned the war’s “darkest moment” was unfolding in the north of the Strip. After days of laying siege to the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, the Israeli military twice entered the hospital compound over the past 24 hours and opened fire at parts of the complex, the Gaza health ministry and the hospital director told CNN. The facility is running low on supplies and is in desperate need of aid as injured people from neighboring areas pour in following Israel’s renewed offensive in northern areas, according to health authorities. “One of the darkest moments of the Gaza conflict is unfolding in the north of the Strip,” the UN’s human rights chief Volker Turk said Friday. “The Israeli military is effectively subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and risk of starvation, as well as being forced to choose between mass displacement and being trapped in an active conflict zone,” he added, warning that Israel’s actions could amount to crimes against humanity. Gaza’s health ministry said Saturday that Israeli troops have detained all male medical staff at the hospital “while confining women in one of the hospital rooms without water or food.” World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that since the raid on Kamal Adwan hospital, WHO has “lost touch with the personnel there.” “This development is deeply disturbing given the number of patients being served and people sheltering there,” Ghebreyesus said on X. Prior to Friday’s raid, he said, WHO and its partners managed to reach Kamal Adwan “amid hostilities in the vicinity, and transferred 23 patients and 26 caregivers to Al-Shifa Hospital.” Ghebreyesus said later Saturday that Israel’s raid on the hospital was over, but came “at a heavy cost.” After 44 male staff members detained, the hospital’s female staff, the hospital director and one other male doctor were left to care for “nearly 200 patients in desperate need of medical attention,” said Ghebreyesus. Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, the hospital director, said in a video that Israeli tanks and bulldozers entered the hospital compound late Thursday and began firing at parts of the complex, adding that “all departments of the hospital are under direct shelling.” “Instead of receiving aid, we are receiving tanks,” he said. After an hours-long communications blackout and “intense bombardment,” Safiya told CNN late Friday that Israeli troops were still present in the hospital. “We all gathered in one place, and then the army called for me. When I went down, they put me inside a tank and began interrogating me about my statements and contact with the media,” Abu Safiya recounted. He said the Israeli military were “searching all the rooms, evacuating the displaced people and removing 44 staff members” as he spoke. “The situation is extremely tragic and terrifying, and the bombing is continuous,” Abu Safiya said. Kamal Adwan is one of three minimally operational hospitals in northern Gaza, and the closest to Israeli military activity in Beit Lahiya and the Jabalya Refugee Camp. Despite its limited capacity, it has been receiving most of the injured from the surrounding fighting. The Israeli military said in a statement Friday that its forces are operating in the area of the Kamal Adwan Hospital “based on intelligence information regarding the presence of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure,” adding that in the weeks preceding the operation, “the IDF facilitated the evacuation of patients from the area while maintaining emergency services.” COGAT, the Israeli agency that manages the flow of aid into the strip, said on Friday that with the help of UNICEF and WHO, several patients and their escorts were evacuated from the facility. The hospital was also given fuel, blood units and medical equipment. Maher Shamiya, an official with the Gaza health ministry, told CNN Friday that the Israeli military had demolished parts of the hospital’s wall. The oxygen station had also been damaged by Israeli fire, he said. Shamiya said that the military had entered the hospital yard for a second time on Friday morning and had begun separating men from women. “After that, it became impossible to communicate with anyone.” In his video message, Safiya said he was “shocked by the entry of bulldozers and tanks into the hospital compound,” adding that tanks began firing at the upper floors, shattering windows and “creating an atmosphere of panic, terror, and fear.” “Everyone in the hospital gathered in the stairwell; it was a very distressing scene,” he said. One video showed Abu Safiya speaking from within the Intensive Care Unit, where patients and medical staff were huddled. He said that some severely injured people were dying. Abu Safiya said that a number of properties around the hospital had been set on fire. Later Thursday night, a convoy of supplies from the World Health Organization reached the hospital, he said. Video showed a fuel tanker and other vehicles close to the facility. Abu Safiya said the convoy delivered enough fuel for five days, as well as 200 units of blood and a few other supplies, but no food or water. He said he had been in touch with Israeli officers. “I explained the situation of the patients and the injured people in the hospital, emphasizing that their condition was extremely critical and that evacuation was necessary.” The health ministry in Gaza told CNN Friday that 23 injured people had been evacuated in six ambulances. Abu Safiya said there were 70 critically injured people at the hospital needing evacuation. Abu Safiya also told CNN that there was a large number of injured people in the Jabalya area of northern Gaza, which has been subjected to intense Israeli military operations in recent days. “We have no medical assistance that can reach them, and I do not have the means to help them even if they were able to reach us. We have nothing to offer them.” It has been 21 days since Israel ramped up its military operation in northern Gaza. Authorities in Gaza say the military has stopped aid from reaching parts of the area and displaced many of its residents. Israel says it is preventing Hamas from regrouping.

Why these Republicans think voting against Trump could save the GOP,"John King,CNN","6:01 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",8 minute,,"Michael Pesce is conservative in the truest sense of the word. He speaks with an economy of words. He holds himself to a high standard but prefers not to judge others. He gets through tasks methodically, wasting no time or energy – even when enjoying his hobbies. Pesce is a hunter, and Pennsylvania deer season overlaps with election season. Archery hunting is open now, with a rifle hunting period set to open in November. So Pesce stopped by the ranges at a state park recently to check his gear. “Hunting season is starting,” Pesce said. “That’s more important than any election for a lot of people.” First, several shots at the archery targets, where Pesce at one point used a dime to adjust his bow sight. Once satisfied, it was down to the nearby firearm area. Pesce set his target 100 yards down range, and set his .30-6 hunting rifle on its stand. A few stalls down, two men were firing AR-15-style assault rifles. Dozens of shots, the empty shells piling up at their feet. Pesce quietly made note of how loud it was, then got about his business: just three shots to adjust his rifle scope, then two more to allow a visitor to test his aim and get a feel for the rifle. Then time to pack up, taking even the empty shells Pesce recycles for new bullets. A Coast Guard veteran. A Reagan Republican. A Nikki Haley voter in the April GOP primary who will be a Kamala Harris voter a week from Tuesday. Pesce’s conservative principles tell him he can never vote for Donald Trump. And they tell him he has to vote for Harris, to try to keep Trump out of the White House, even though Pesce doesn’t like surprises and does not believe the vice president has clearly laid out a governing vision. “That’s the scary part,” Pesce said. “I am not voting for a candidate. I’m not voting for a policy. I’m voting against a candidate and policies, and not even all the policies. Just, you know, the unstableness. Some of the things he says are truly scary.” Pesce is part of our All Over The Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are part of potentially decisive voting blocs. In Pesce’s case, he’s one of the Republicans in the counties that surround Philadelphia who supported Haley in the primary even though the former South Carolina governor had exited the race weeks before. They’re voters who view Trump as anything but conservative or principled. In many cases, they believe Trump must be defeated again to shake their party out of his spell. “If Trump loses, then I think Republicans will start coming back to what they were,” Pesce said. “Because they won’t have that radical right side. They won’t have the craziness and instability.” It was our third visit in five months, and Pesce, true to his conservatism, has been consistent: He said in May he would vote for President Joe Biden even as he raised concerns about his age and took issue with some of his agenda. In conversations since the switch to Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, Pesce has made clear he sees a duty to try to block Trump. He recently traveled West through several states that are reliably Republican. Turning on the TV or the radio was different. He returned to Pennsylvania even more mindful that he lives in the biggest of the presidential battleground prizes. “No one’s ever been through anything like this,” he said of the 2024 campaign. “Is this an election for Americans, or is this for those seven states?” It is important to remember our project is anecdotal reporting; the voters we are tracking, in this case Haley primary supporters, are not necessarily representative of the full universe of such voters. Yet they still provide us with valuable and sometimes telling insights. And they live in places that will be critical to the final math of who wins Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes. This time, we met Pesce at a state range in New Tripoli, which is in blue-collar Lehigh County. He lives a few miles away in Bucks County, which in recent elections has been the most competitive of the suburban collar counties that surround Philadelphia. Those collar counties represent one of the crucial 2024 math tests: Can Harris hold or build on Biden’s 2020 suburban strength or will Trump claw back at least to his 2016 performance, when he lost the Philadelphia suburbs but by a smaller margin than in 2020? In a state so competitive, tiny shifts can make the difference. Joan London and Berks County offer another glimpse at the battlegrounds within the battlegrounds. Berks is still red when you look at election maps, and it is too far out to be considered a Philadelphia suburb. But as the suburbs grow and change, often the exurbs do, too. Still farmland, but more given up to homes and services. Still plenty of Trump signs, but in some pockets surprising competition. “This neighborhood is becoming a lot like the Philadelphia suburbs,” said London, an attorney who was born closer to Philly, in Montgomery County. “This is a primarily Republican leaning borough, always has been. But when it comes to national elections, I do see more and more support for Democratic candidates.” A walk down London’s leafy street in Wyomissing proves her point. No Trump signs but Harris signs on several of the lawns on her block. Not her house. London’s lawn has one sign supporting a Republican legislative candidate. But London is voting for Harris – the first time she will vote Democrat for president. “Sometimes you have to say American first, conservative second and Republican third,” London said. Her decision is a shift from when we first met in May. Then, London told us she voted in the GOP primary for Haley but then switched her registration to independent because she opposes Trump and what she sees as his dangerous populism. But back then she said she would write in a conservative because she could not support Biden. She was even more firm in that belief just after Harris took over the ticket because she views the vice president as more liberal than Biden. She had settled on Pat Toomey, a conservative former senator from Pennsylvania, as her write-in choice. Then she watched the Trump-Harris debate, and it stirred why, back at the age of 18, she chose to be a Reagan Republican. “The last straw was what he said about the Ukraine,” London said. “When he said we have to have a negotiated settlement. … For someone who claims to be a conservative to say that was, in my opinion, outrageous. It’s appeasement. It’s dangerous.” She slept on what that debate answer stirred in her. And she awoke a Harris voter because, like Pesce, she believes the only way to get her party back is for Trump to be defeated. “I needed to vote against allowing him to become president again,” London said. She knows the polling in Pennsylvania and other swing states is tight and that Trump could well win. “I don’t want it on my conscience that I contributed in some way to that,” London said. London is reluctant to speak for others but believes she may have company among at least some fellow local conservatives. “I was surprised by how many people came up to me and kind of whispered, ‘I feel the same way as you do,’” she said. “So I have a feeling there are quite a few private conversations that are occurring behind the scenes in Republican and conservative circles.” It could matter if London has company. Hillary Clinton lost Berks County by 18,189 votes. Biden lost it, too, but by a slightly smaller margin: 16,841. That 1,348 vote difference seems tiny, maybe insignificant, when you note that Pennsylvania has more than 9 million registered voters. But ‘every vote counts’ is not a cliché in the battlegrounds: Trump’s winning margin here in 2016 was just 44,292; Biden’s in 2020 was 81,660. Cynthia Sabatini is another Haley voter who now factors into the battleground math. She lives in Media, in suburban Delaware County. Sabatini is a registered Republican but she has never voted for Trump. And she says she never will. “Trump is a non starter for me,” she said in a recent interview at home. But she is not sold on Harris, either, and her questions track what we hear from a lot of voters in our travels, even committed supporters of the vice president. “I don’t know who she is,” Sabatini said. “I really don’t. Because she had different positions than she does now. But she continues to say they are within her value system. So connect the dots for me.” What can Harris do to win her vote in these final days? “You need to answer questions on point,” Sabatini said. “You need to provide more details about your economic plan. You need to provide more details about your vision for this country.” Sabatini wrote in a Republican senator in 2016 when Trump won Pennsylvania. She voted for Biden in 2020. She is well aware of the 2024 math, and friends voting for Harris aren’t shy about reminding her how critical it is for the vice president to get big margins in the suburbs. “I don’t care what they personally think about that,” Sabatini said. “I don’t want to be forced into making a decision between one of the two.” She meditates frequently, sometimes twice a day, and says it can clear the mind for tough choices. As she ponders hers, she shares this: “I think Trump is going to win.” That, she said, is based on betting lines, not the polls. Sabatini does not want Trump back in the White House. She has a mail-in ballot and plans to drop it off on Election Day. Her decision could come as late as that morning. She will make it according to her beliefs: Either Harris will win her over or she will cast another write in, with Haley her leading choice if it comes to that. “The lion’s share of my friends are Democrats,” she said. “They think at the 11th hour people will have such reservations about Trump that it will cause them to vote for Harris. I don’t see it that way.”"
"In Texas, Harris embraces Beyoncé and warns swing-state voters that ‘Trump abortion bans’ are coming for them","Gregory Krieg,Priscilla Alvarez,Kaanita Iyer,CNN","1:19 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",4 minute,,"Vice President Kamala Harris, after being endorsed and embraced onstage in Houston by music superstar Beyoncé, warned voters across the country Friday night that Texas-style abortion bans would end up in their states if Donald Trump returns to the White House. Harris has leaned hard into her abortion rights message in the final days of the campaign, amplifying the stories of women affected by the state-level restrictions that followed the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade. Texas was chosen as the location for the rally, campaign officials said earlier, because of its harsh abortion ban. “Know this,” Harris said, addressing a national audience. “If you think you are protected from Trump abortion bans because you live in Michigan or Pennsylvania or Nevada or New York or California, or any state where voters or legislators have protected reproductive freedom, please know: No one is protected if there is a Trump national abortion ban.” Texas has some of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country, banning the procedure at six weeks – before many women know they are pregnant – with exceptions only in the case of life endangerment for the mother. A “trigger law” passed in 2021 took effect after the gutting of federal abortion rights in June 2022. Before Harris, Beyoncé or Rep. Colin Allred, the Democrat running for Senate in Texas, took the stage, the campaign offered the microphone to women who shared stories about potentially deadly health emergencies caused by new anti-abortion state laws that prevent doctors from acting swiftly when a pregnant woman’s health is in danger.

      Supreme Court won’t let Biden administration force Texas hospitals to provide emergency abortion care Amanda and Josh Zurawski, the Texas couple who led a lawsuit against the state after Amanda suffered life-threatening pregnancy complications because she was refused care, were among those telling their story. Shanette Williams – the mother of Amber Nicole Thurman, who died in 2022 from a treatable infection following delays in treatment stemming from Georgia’s abortion ban – was also in attendance. Harris in her remarks pointed to Josh Zurawski as she sought to grab the attention of male voters. “Men across America do not want to see their daughters and wives and sisters and mothers put at risk because their rights have been taken,” Harris said. “I see the men here. And I thank you. The men of America do not want this.” Beyoncé, whose song “Freedom” is played at Harris rallies, made a rare appearance at the event. After being introduced by her mother, the Houston native – joined onstage by former Destiny’s Child bandmate Kelly Rowland – said the country was on the “brink of history.” “I’m not here as a celebrity. I’m not here as a politician,” said the singer, who did not perform Friday. “I’m here as a mother.” Texas music legend Willie Nelson also attended Friday’s rally and played two songs for the crowd, asking them, “Are we ready to say, ‘Madam President’?” Earlier in the day, Trump took aim at his Democratic rival, saying at an event in the Texas capital of Austin that she was in the state “to rub shoulders with woke celebrities.” Before Harris took over the top of the Democratic ticket following President Joe Biden’s decision to stand down, she was the administration’s go-to voice on abortion rights. Her campaign released a new ad before the rally, called “He Did It,” that drew a straight line from Trump’s presidency – and his choices to sit on the Supreme Court – to the court’s decision striking down Roe, which opened the floodgates for statewide abortion bans. The campaign bought local television ad time in Texas for the first time to coincide with Harris’ visit. On the campaign trail, Harris has often labeled extreme measures on abortion rights being adopted across the country as a “health care crisis,” and she has argued that Trump is “the architect of this crisis.” Harris also connected Texas’ current effort to block a new administration rule meant to shield the health information of women who travel out of state in search of safe, legal abortions, to Trump’s ongoing refusal to share his own records. “On the one hand, Donald Trump won’t let anybody see his medical records. I gave up mine. And on the other hand, they want to get their hands on your medical records,” Harris said. “Simply put, they are out of their minds.” While in Houston, Harris also sat down for an interview with popular podcaster Brené Brown, the latest stop on her new media tour.

"SpaceX Crew-8 astronaut hospitalized but in ‘stable condition’ after splashdown, NASA says","Jackie Wattles,CNN","2:04 PM EDT, Fri October 25, 2024",3 minute,"Science,Space","Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Three NASA astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut were unexpectedly transferred to a medical facility in Florida rather than returning to their home base in Houston after their splashdown early Friday morning aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. One of those astronauts remained in the hospital Friday afternoon with a “medical issue,” while the three others flew to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston after a health evaluation at Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola, a hospital near the crew’s splashdown site in the Gulf of Mexico. NASA did not provide any further details about the crew member who remained at the medical facility. “To protect the crew member’s medical privacy, specific details on the individual’s condition or identity will not be shared,” according to a Friday afternoon statement from NASA news chief Cheryl Warner. “The one astronaut who remains at Ascension is in stable condition under observation as a precautionary measure,” the statement said. The four-person crew, which spent nearly eight months aboard the International Space Station before landing in the Gulf of Mexico at 3:29 a.m. ET Friday, had a “safe splashdown and recovery,” NASA said Friday morning. However, all four astronauts “were taken to a local medical facility for additional evaluation,” according to an update from Warner shared at 8 a.m. ET. The measure was taken for the entire crew “out of an abundance of caution,” according to NASA. The four crewmates — including NASA astronauts Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps and Alexander Grebenkin of the Russian space agency Roscosmos — make up the staff of Crew-8, a routine mission to the International Space Station that Space X carried out on behalf of NASA. All four astronauts were seen smiling and waving as they exited their Crew Dragon capsule and boarded a recovery ship during a live stream of their splashdown overnight. Related article
      A SpaceX capsule just came back to Earth. Here’s why Boeing Starliner’s astronauts weren’t on it Officials at NASA also did not offer any indication of medical issues during a 5 a.m. ET news briefing. “Right now the crew is doing great. They are going to spend a little bit of time on the recovery vessel going through their medical checks,” said Richard Jones, NASA’s deputy manager of the Commercial Crew Program, at the time. “They’ll soon be on their way back to Houston after all of those are done.” Extensive medical checkouts are routine after long-duration missions to space. And Crew-8’s stay was a bit longer than most astronauts traveling to the space station. Routinely trips typically last roughly five to seven months. “(Crew-8 was) the longest duration in space for a US crewed vehicle at 235 days,” Jones said. The Crew-8 team, which launched into space on March 4, faced repeated delays in their return home for a variety of reasons. Among the roadblocks were schedule changes related to issues with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, which had carried two NASA astronauts to the space station on a test flight in June but was deemed too risky to return its crew back to Earth. NASA ultimately chose to return the Boeing spacecraft home empty and moved Starliner’s astronauts onto the SpaceX Crew-9 mission, delaying that mission’s launch and thus Crew-8’s return. Additional weather delays also pushed the Crew-8 astronauts’ return into late October."
