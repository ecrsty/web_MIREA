Trump appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast for nearly three hours: Here are the top moments,Trump tapes 'The Joe Rogan Experience' podcast,Danielle Wallace,"October 26, 2024 7:45am EDT October 26, 2024 2:08pm EDT",Donald Trump,"Former President Donald Trump explains how he settled conflict with North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. Former President Trump taped ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast for nearly three hours on Friday. The podcast, recorded in Austin, Texas, afforded the Republican presidential nominee exposure to Rogan's 14.5 million followers on Spotify and 17.6 million followers on YouTube. Rogan, the nation's most-listened-to podcast host, is extremely influential with young male voters, who Trump is aiming to reach. Here are the top takeaways from the podcast that aired on Friday. Trump told Rogan that he regretted some of the appointments he made in his first-term. ""The one question that you'll ask me that I think you'll ask me that people seem to ask -- and I always come up with the same answer – if I, the one mistake because I had a lot of success, great economy, great everyth, everything was great with the military rebuilt the biggest tax cuts in history, all the stuff we did, we had a great presidency,"" Trump said. ""Three Supreme Court justices. Most people get none. You know, you pick them young this way. They're there for 50 years. Right. So, you know, even if a president is there for eight years, oftentimes they never have a chance. I had three. It was the luck of the draw.""""But I will say that it always comes back to the same answer,"" Trump said. ""The biggest mistake I made was I picked some people, I picked some great people, you know, but you don't think about that. I picked some people that I shouldn't have picked. I picked a few people that I shouldn't have picked."" ""And neocons,"" Rogan said. ""Yeah, neocons or bad people or disloyal people,"" Trump said. While explaining the process of choosing political nominations once he got into office, Trump discussed his initial appointment of John Bolton, who served as White House National Security adviser. In 2019, Trump fired Bolton, who remains a staunch critic. Trump described how Phil Ruffin, a fellow American businessman, warned him that Bolton was a ""bad guy,"" but by then, Trump had already hired him. Podcast host Joe Rogan told former President Trump he has gotten so popular with Americans due to the ""wild s---"" he says.  (The Joe Rogan Experience) ""And he was right. But he was good in a certain way. He's a nut job. And every time I had to deal with a country when they saw this whack job standing behind me, they said, 'Man, Trump's going to go to war with us.' He was with Bush when they went stupidly into the Middle East. They should have never done it. I used to say it as a civilian, so I always got more publicity than other people,"" Trump said. ""It wasn't like I was trying,"" Trump said. ""In fact, I don't know exactly why. Maybe you can tell me."" ""I could definitely tell you,"" Rogan offered. ""You said a lot of wild s---. … And then CNN in all their brilliance by highlighting your wild s--- made you much more popular. And they boost you in the polls because people were tired of someone talking in this bulls--- pre-prepared politician lingo. And even if they didn't agree with you, they at least knew whoever that guy is, that's him. That's really him."" ""The rebels are Republicans now, though, like you want to be invisible, you want to be punk rock, you want to like, buck the system? You're a conservative now,"" Rogan said. ""That's how crazy. And then the liberals are now pro-silencing criticism. They're pro-censorship online. … [T]hey come in regulating free speech and now regulating the First Amendment. It's bananas to watch."" Elon Musk, who took over Twitter — now X — in 2022, responded to the clip, writing, ""Exactly."" ""You know they come after their political opponent,"" Trump told Rogan in response. ""I've been investigated more than Alfonse Capone."" In his meeting with former President Obama during the presidential transition period, Trump recalled, ""Obama thought we were going to go to war with North Korea."" Rogan then referenced how Trump dubbed North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un ""Little Rocket Man"" early on in his first term. ""I said, 'Little Rocket Man, you're going to burn in hell.' And it was rough,"" Trump said. ""I got to know him better than anybody, anybody. And I said, 'Do you ever do anything else? Why don't you go take it easy and relax? Go to the beach?' You know, kiddingly, I said, 'You're always building nuclear. Just relax. You don't have to do it. Let's build some condos.'"" Rogan praised Trump for partnering with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to ""Make America Healthy Again"" and asked the Republican presidential nominee if he would completely commit to having Kennedy, a former independent presidential candidate, as part of his administration. ""Oh, I am, but the only thing I want to be a little careful about with him is the environmental. Because, you know, he doesn't like oil. I love oil,"" Trump said. ""I think just keep him out of the fire. So I'm going to keep him out of a little bit. I said focus on health. Focus. You could do whatever you want, but, I got to be a little bit careful with the liquid gold."" Rogan, showing Trump charts, referenced how ""there are chemicals and ingredients in our food that are illegal in other countries because they've been shown to be toxic."" ""There's pesticides and herbicides, and there's a lot of sh-- that's been sprayed on our food that really is unnecessary,"" the podcaster said. ""And there's a lot of health consequences."" Rogan added that Kennedy recently told him that ""more than 70% of young men are ineligible for the military because of their health."" ""But RFK is going to be – you know I think he's a great guy,"" Trump said. Rogan also asked if Trump faced pressure not to work with Kennedy. JOE ROGAN TELLS TRUMP THE 'WILD S---' HE SAYS FUELED HIS POPULARITY DURING THREE HOUR PODCAST INTERVIEW""But I would say that the Big Pharma wasn't thrilled when they heard that,"" Trump said. ""I've actually always gotten along very well with him. I've known him a long time. He's a different kind of a guy. He's very smart, great guy, and he's very sincere about this. I mean, he really is. You know, he thinks we spend a fortune on pesticides and all this stuff, and then you end up at that chart is a terrible shot."" Rogan and Trump discussed the botched Afghanistan withdrawal under the Biden-Harris administration. In addition to the 13 U.S. service members killed in a suicide bombing at Kabul airport, Rogan referenced how the United States left behind billions of dollars worth of equipment now seen in Taliban military parades. Trump said President Biden should have fired everyone involved in planning the withdrawal, taking issue with retired Gen. Mark Milley, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Trump and Biden. Trump said U.S. troops should have left last from Bagram Air Base because it's located ""one hour away from where China makes its nuclear missiles"" and should have taken all their equipment with them. ""Every plane, every screw  should have been taken out, every tent. And I said that. That's when I realized that Milley was a dummy. I said, 'we're leaving, but I want to get everything out,'"" Trump said. ""'Sir, it's cheaper to leave it,'"" Trump said Milley told him. ""It's cheaper to leave it?"" Rogan asked. ""Yeah, he said it's cheaper to leave it,"" Trump affirmed. ""Cheaper?"" Rogan asked again. ""Not more dangerous?"" ""He just said cheaper,"" Trump said. ""I said ‘I want every plane, I want every tank, I want the goggles, said night goggles. They have all this stuff that these guys now have.’ He said, 'sir, it's cheaper to get out and leave it.' I said, so you think it's cheaper to leave $150 million brand new airplane in there than it is to fly it out with a tank of jet fuel and put it in Pakistan, or just fly it directly back?"" ""'It's cheaper to leave it.' I said, 'this guy's nuts,'"" Trump added. ""I'm telling you, he was so stupid. He was so unwise. He was like an unwise man. And there were a number of them."" Trump also recalled how he spoke with Taliban’s chief negotiator Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. ""I had a couple of conversations with Abdul, and from the time I had those conversations, because they were shooting our soldiers, you know, with the sniper stuff,"" Trump said. ""They were shooting a lot with Obama, much less with me. But they were shooting them. And I said, get this guy on the phone. The press went nuts when they heard this. I had a great conversation – It was a tough conversation. 18 months later, there wasn't one soldier that was ever shot at, and even Biden admitted it in a moment of stupidity."" Trump spoke of efforts to have cars made in the United States, specifically to revitalize the once booming industry in Detroit, Michigan. Recently, Trump threatened a large auto plant ""being built by China in Mexico"" that he would implement 100 or 200% tariffs on every car made there if he wins, so ""they'll be unsaleable in the United States."" In response, the plant reportedly announced it would stop production. ""This was the biggest plant in the world. It would have more than all of Michigan makes. That's how big,"" Trump said. ""You know, this is what we're getting to. And I said, if that plant goes up, I want them to understand if I win, I'm going to tax those cars at the rate of 100 or 200% apiece so that you won't be able to sell them in the United States. They just announced they're not going to build the plant."" ""I did a big favor for our country by doing that. And I'm not even there yet. To me, the most beautiful word, I've said this for the last couple of weeks in the dictionary today is the word tariff,"" Trump continued. ""It's more beautiful than love, more beautiful than anything. It's the most beautiful word. This country can become rich with the use, the proper use of tariffs."" ""Did you just float out the idea of getting rid of income taxes and replacing it with tariffs?"" Rogan interjected. ""Were you serious about that?"" ""Yeah, sure. Why not?"" Trump said. ""Our country was the richest, relatively in the 1880s and 1890s. A president who was assassinated, named McKinley, he was the tariff king."" ""He spoke beautifully of terrorists. His language was really beautiful. ‘We will not allow the enemy to come in and take our jobs and take our factories and take our workers and take our families unless they pay a big price. And the big price is tariffs.’ And he'd speak like that. But he was right,"" Trump said. ""And then around in the early 1900s, they switched over stupidly to, frankly, an income tax."" Trump said he has interviewed jet pilots who described seeing what looked like a ball that traveled four times faster than an F-22 plane, opening the conversation up to the subject of UFOs. ""It's not a great interest for me, but it's a little interest. I get that question as much as almost any question. Do you think that we have aliens coming, you know, flying around or whatever?"" Trump said. ""I mean, there's no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don't have life, you know?"" Trump described Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Karris as a ""very low IQ person,"" when Rogan asked him about how Harris compared her Republican opponent to Adolf Hitler. ""There's the rhetoric is also that you're Hitler and that in order to stop Hitler, you have to do whatever,"" Rogan said. ""I mean, you're hearing this now, Kamala compared you, said you love Hitler yesterday."" ""Kamala is a very low IQ person. She's a very low IQ. You know, I'm for taking tests too. I think anybody that runs for president should take, they should give them a test,"" Trump said. ""And it's not an age thing,"" Trump said. ""If you look back on history, 70s and 80s, your greatest, some of your greatest leaders in the world, world history, long time world history, they were in their 70s, in their 80s. But I think you should take cognitive tests. I think everybody – they say it's unconstitutional, but I think that's ridiculous. I think Kamala should have a test because there's something missing. There's something wrong with her."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Well, I think it's pressure,"" Rogan said. ""I think the pressure and the scrutiny. You've been a celebrity for a long time, and you understand what this is like. But for someone who's in her late 40s, who becomes the vice president, who runs for president, becomes a vice president, and then all of a sudden, the weight of the world is on your shoulders. And there's all these people, a lot of people clam up."" ""But you either have it or you don't,"" Trump said. Rogan agreed, ""Correct."" From the official vice presidential residence at the White House on Wednesday, Harris accepted the claim of former Trump White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, who said Trump wanted ""Hitler's generals."" Harris said her GOP opponent is ""unhinged"" and seeks ""unchecked power."" Rogan acknowledged how the Republican presidential nominee appeared on his friend and fellow comedian Theo Von's ""This Past Weekend"" podcast in August. ""Is that why you called me to do this?"" Trump asked. ""No, no,"" Rogan said. ""Once they shot you, I was like, he's got to come in here. It's all about timing. I think our timing is perfect… Do you even have a scar on your ear? You got anything on there?"" ""I do,"" Trump said, ""so right over here."" ""Oh, it's a tiny mark,"" Rogan said. ""It zinged right there,"" Trump said, motioning to the side of his ear. ""It healed up pretty f---ing good,"" Rogan offered. ""Yeah, it's pretty good. Yeah, it's a little... It's not like some of the wrestlers, some of the UFC fighters,"" Trump said. ""It was sort of like a top shot.. but it makes me a tougher guy."" Danielle Wallace is a breaking news and politics reporter at Fox News Digital.

He reminded the former president that the women of the program were once friendly towards him. ""It was the episode of you when you're on The View,"" Rogan said.

Harris-Trump presidential showdown: Dead even 10 days before Election Day,Both campaigns and their surrogates are fanning out across battleground states this weekend,Paul Steinhauser,"October 26, 2024 4:00am EDT",Politics,"RealClearPolitics co-founder Tom Bevan reacts to recent polling, defends Kamala Harris’ visit to Texas and reveals which states each candidate can benefit by visiting less than two weeks before Election Day. With 10 days until Election Day, two new major national polls indicate Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump are in a dead heat in the race to succeed President Biden in the White House. With the clock quickly ticking, the two nominees and their running mates are fanning out across the key battleground states this weekend. Trump starts Saturday with a rally in Novi, Michigan, in suburban Detroit. Later in the day, he'll campaign in another of the crucial swing states — Pennsylvania — as he holds a rally in State College, home to Penn State University.

The stop comes two days after the vice president shared the stage in suburban Atlanta with former President Obama.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a two-time runner-up for the Democratic nomination, stumps for Harris in Erie. On Sunday, Harris is scheduled to make multiple retail stops in Philadelphia. Trump will hold a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City, the media capital of the world. Trump's campaign says the former president, who has long wanted to hold a rally in the legendary New York City venue, will frame his closing argument during the rally. And the campaign will hold a backstage fundraiser for major donors with top-tier access costing $924,600. It can't get any closer than this. Two major national polls conducted Sunday through Wednesday and released Friday indicate Harris and Trump in a dead heat. Former President Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, laughs after speaking during a campaign rally Thursday in Las Vegas. (AP/Alex Brandon) Grabbing headlines first is a New York Times/Siena College survey indicating the Democratic Party and GOP presidential nominees are tied at 48%. That's a switch from a previous poll, earlier this month, when Harris held a slight three-point edge. A CNN survey had the candidates deadlocked at 47% among likely voters nationwide. Its previous poll from late September indicated the vice president had a razor-thin one-point margin. There were warning signs in the two surveys for both candidates, however. Harris lost her favorability advantage over Trump in both polls. After replacing President Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in July, the vice president's favorable ratings soared. But they've steadily eroded over the past month. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, speaks during a campaign event at Riverside Park in Grand Rapids, Mich., Oct. 18. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Another red flag for Harris are polls indicating her support among Black voters is below Biden's levels in the 2020 election. For Trump, his support among White voters is on par with his standing in the 2020 election, when he lost the White House to Biden. And the former president still faces a healthy deficit to the vice president when it comes to being trustworthy and caring about people. While national polls are closely watched, the race for the White House is not based on the national popular vote. It's a battle for the states and their electoral votes. FROM ‘JOYFUL WARRIOR’ TO CALLING TRUMP A ‘FACIST,’ KAMALA HARRIS CHANGES HER MESSAGING IN THE FINAL STRETCH And the latest surveys in the seven crucial battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump and will likely determine whether Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election, are mostly within the margin of error. The latest Fox News national poll indicated Trump had a two-point edge, but Harris had a 6-point advantage among respondents questioned in all seven battleground states. Former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris (Fox News) While there's a margin of error in the polls, there is a clear frontrunner in the battle for campaign cash, another important indicator in presidential politics. And it's Harris. According to the latest figures the two major party presidential campaigns filed with the Federal Election Commission, Harris hauled in $97 million during the first half of October. That far outpaced the $16 million the Trump campaign said it raised during the first half of this month. Both campaigns use a number of affiliated fundraisings committees to raise money. And when those are included, Trump narrowed the gap, but trailed $176 million to $97 million during the first two weeks of this month.

Progressives upset Kamala Harris is campaigning with Liz Cheney: Report,"'Don't take the progressive movement for granted,' a director of a progressive group told the AP",Hanna Panreck,"October 26, 2024 2:20pm EDT",Media,"CNN host Jake Tapper pressed Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday about why Kamala Harris was campaigning with Liz Cheney, a Republican, and not him. Some progressive Democrats are upset with Vice President Kamala Harris' decision to lean on Liz Cheney in the weeks ahead of the election, suggesting the vice president should focus more on her Democratic base. ""The truth of the matter is that there are a hell of a lot more working-class people who could vote for Kamala Harris than there are conservative Republicans,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT., told the Associated Press. Cheney, an anti-Trump Republican, has appeared on the campaign trail with Harris several times. Other progressive leaders, such as Sanders or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have been ""relegated to low-profile roles,"" according to the AP. ""She has to start talking more to the needs of working-class people,"" Sanders told the AP. ""I wish this had taken place two months ago. It is what it is."" CNN's Jake Tapper asked Bernie Sanders on Sunday why VP Kamala Harris was campaigning with Liz Cheney and not him. (Screenshot/CNN) ""There’s been an odd disconnect between the campaign’s economic populist ad strategy and the event strategy that focuses almost exclusively on Liz Cheney kumbaya optics that depress the base right as voting begins and don’t provably win more swing voters than bread-and-butter issues,"" Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, told the AP. However, Green praised the Harris campaign for focusing their ads on grocery prices and economics. Joseph Geevarghese, the executive director of the progressive group Our Revolution, told the AP that 10% of progressives might not vote for Harris and warned some might vote for Trump. ""We just want to raise a red flag. Don’t take the progressive movement for granted,"" Geevarghese said. ""There’s got to be an economic argument at the end of the day. That’s the No. 1 thing that matters to voters.""

""What does it say that Kamala Harris is starting this week with only 16 days left, campaigning with Liz Cheney, a very conservative former congresswoman, daughter of Dick Cheney, obviously, but she has not yet held a public campaign event with you, arguably the leader of the progressive movement in the United States?"" Tapper asked. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sanders said that it had to do with ""people really disgusted with Trump’s constant lying with his attempt to prevent the first peaceful transition of power"" and his ""undermining of American democracy."" Sanders has campaigned for Harris but has not appeared with the vice president on the trail. The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

JERUSALEM—After Israel’s daring aerial military strikes in Iran early Saturday, the Jewish state announced that it is prepared to continue to go on the ""offense"" against the world’s worst state-sponsor of terrorism, the Islamic Republic of Iran, if Tehran responds. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said, ""If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation - we will be obligated to respond. Our message is clear: All those who threaten the State of Israel and seek to drag the region into a wider escalation — will pay a heavy price."" He added, ""We demonstrated today that we have both the capability and the resolve to act decisively — and we are prepared — on offense and defense — to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel."" US MADE AWARE OF ISRAEL'S STRIKE ON IRAN DAYS IN ADVANCE; IDF SAYS MISSION COMPLETE Iranian air defense reportedly operating as Israel began striking Iranian targets in Tehran. (Obtained by Fox News) Israel dubbed its Saturday mission ""Days of Repentance"" as a response to Iran’s launch of its barrage of around 200 ballistic missiles on October 1 into the Holy Land. Iran said it attacked Israel as retaliation for the IDF’s elimination of the Tehran-backed global Hezbollah terrorist, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut. Pressure on Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from the Biden-Harris administration seems to have paid off on Jerusalem limiting its historic attack on Iran to purely military installations. Israel avoided knocking out Iran’s illicit nuclear weapons sites and its vast oil production enterprises. ""Israel opted for the least-aggressive response against the Islamic Republic by conducting precise strikes on military targets,"" noted Lisa Daftari, an Iran expert and editor-in-chief of The Foreign Desk. Daftari told Fox News Digita, ""This approach raises questions about whether the U.S. influenced Israel to adopt a more restrained response, possibly to prevent further escalation. One could argue these strikes successfully reestablished deterrence, while it can also be said that Israel missed an opportunity to target more crucial sites. Many factors, including the timing, target selection, and strike intensity, were complicated by a U.S. leak and our upcoming elections. Despite these pressures, Israel appears prepared to change its approach if the Islamic Republic decides to escalate further."" Israeli Air Force planes departing for the strikes in Iran last night. (IDF Spokesman's Unit) On Saturday, Secretary of Defense Austin issued a statement on X noting that he had spoken with his Israeli counterpart where he ""reaffirmed the ironclad commitment of the United States to Israel’s security and right to self-defense. I made it clear that the United States maintains an enhanced force posture to defend U.S. personnel, Israel, and partners across the region in the face of threats from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist organizations and is determined to prevent any actor from exploiting tensions or expanding the conflict in the region."" A senior U.S. official said on Friday that ""Israel conducted precision airstrikes against multiple military targets across Iran and outside populated areas."" The official added that the United States played no role in the mission and the ""President and his national security team, of course, worked with the Israelis over recent weeks to encourage Israel to conduct it, to conduct a response that was targeted and proportional. A lower risk of civilian harm. And that appears to have been precisely what transpired this evening."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his telephone call with President Biden earlier this month, where Israel's response to Iran was reportedly discussed. (Israeli Prime Minister's Office) Mardo Soghom, the Chief Editor of Iran International English website, told Fox News Digital, ""The regime and its media are downplaying the attack. They are saying it was ineffective, and the air defenses are wonderful. They claim Israel's attack had minimal damage. Some of the regime’s hardliners are openly urging a counter-attack. Iran’s foreign ministry is saying its right of response is still reserved."" ISRAEL BEGINS RETALIATORY STRIKES AGAINST IRAN FOLLOWING MISSILE BARRAGE TARGETING ISRAELIS He chalked up the foreign ministry response to cliché-like diplomatic language and noted that ""No one witnessed the S-300"" air defense system being fired, suggesting that Israel’s bypassed Iran’s vaunted Russian-made counter-missile apparatus.

The U.S. has warned Iran not to respond, so if Iran responds, it could warrant a U.S. response,"" said the Iran expert Soghom. Israeli counterstrikes reportedly killed four Iranian soldiers, one of whom was an officer, according to the regime-controlled media. It is unclear whether Tehran will up the ante and launch new missile attacks against the Jewish state.

In the largest attack by Israel on Iran in history, Jerusalem on Friday launched a wave of retaliatory airstrikes against Iran after the Islamic Republic fired a barrage of missiles toward Israelis earlier this month. Local Israeli news outlet Channel 12 reported that in a direct attack on Iran, Israel sent 140 Air Force planes to the skies for the assault that has reportedly targeted military facilities containing missile exports, drones, ballistic missile transmitters and Iran's air defense systems. The local outlet further reported that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps headquarters in Tehran was hit by strikes, though Fox News has not been able to independently verify this. Explosions were first heard near Iran's capital of Tehran and nearby Karaj, Reuters said, citing local media. ""In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel – right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran,"" the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. ""The regime in Iran and its proxies in the region have been relentlessly attacking Israel since October 7th – on seven fronts – including direct attacks from Iranian soil. Like every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and the duty to respond. Our defensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilized. We will do whatever necessary to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel.""

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR: RESPONSE TO IRAN WILL BE ‘VERY PAINFUL’ National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett further confirmed in a statement that Israel had launched the retaliatory strikes. ""We understand that Israel is conducting targeted strikes against military targets in Iran as an exercise of self-defense and in response to Iran’s ballistic missile attack against Israel on October 1st,"" he said. ""We would refer you to the Israeli government for more information on their operation.""

Iranian media reported that military bases near Tehran were hit, and according to the Tasnim news agency, which has been sanctioned by the U.S. over its ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said no ""fires or explosions"" had been reported at the Tehran refinery, reported the Times of Israel. The Iranian news agency further reported the ""situation in the capital is normal, including at Imam Khomeini (RA) and Mehrabad airports."" There are no reports of fire or explosions at a Tehran refinery,"" Tasnim news agency reports, referring to a key oil refinery south of the capital. ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR: RESPONSE TO IRAN WILL BE ‘VERY PAINFUL’ Iranian air defense reportedly operating as Israel began striking Iranian targets in Tehran. (Obtained by Fox News) The Israeli military action comes after Defense Minister Yoav Gallant vowed a ""precise and deadly"" response to the more than 180 missiles Iran targeted Israel with on Oct. 1, some of which were intercepted with the help of the U.S. Last week, during the leadup to the Israeli attack, reports emerged that the Israeli Defense Forces presented a list of potential targets to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Gallant as officials conducted ""sensitive coordination"" with other countries in the Middle East. ""The regime is vulnerable, and it's up to us to decide which message we want to send to them,"" Israeli ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon also told Fox News Digital. ""It will be very painful for the Iranian regime, and they will think twice in the future whether to attack Israel or not."" Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the barrage of missiles it fired at Israel on Oct. 1 was in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike and the killing of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July. Israel later eliminated Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in a military operation in the Gaza Strip on Oct. 16. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has previously called Nasrallah ""the flag-bearer of resistance"" in the region. ""The blood of the martyr shall not go unavenged,"" Khamenei said following Nasrallah’s death, according to Reuters.

Trump made the remarks while telling supporters about his plans to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. from Mexico and China. ""I think Detroit and some of our areas makes us a developing nation. China doesn’t have any place like that,"" the Republican nominee said. Trump was criticized for previous remarks to the Detroit Economic Club in which he warned ""the whole country will be like – you want to know the truth? It'll be like Detroit,"" if Vice President Harris wins the election. ""It's a mess,"" he said last month. His comments drew blowback from Michigan's Democratic Gov.

He ought to keep Detroit out of his mouth,"" she said.   Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Vice President Kamala Harris is ""desperate"" since she is now calling her opponent former President Trump a ""fascist"" in the closing days of the 2024 campaign. On ""Fox & Friends Weekend,"" McCarthy also said Harris' rhetoric about Trump is becoming ""dangerous,"" noting that two people have tried to shoot Trump this year. ""This is different than any other election. There have been two assassination attempts.

 host Neil Cavuto spoke with Cuban Friday on ""Cavuto: Coast to Coast"" about scenarios where either former President Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris potentially win the presidency this election, asking, ""If [Harris] gets elected president, what cabinet position will Mark Cuban have?"" ""None. Absolutely none. I don’t want one. I don’t wanna work for the government,"" Cuban said, noting that he has a company of his own that is already ""killing it"" and ""changing health care."" ""That’s one of the great things about Kamala Harris. You heard her talk about PBM’s pharmacy benefit middle men, really taking a hammer to them, you’ve seen her talk about transparency which will reduce cost of medications for families and households for 20-30% or more. You know, I think I could have more of an impact on healthcare in general with CostPlusDrugs.com and just doing what I do as an entrepreneur as opposed to working for the government.""

Chris Christie argued with the liberal hosts of ABC's ""The View"" on Friday's show after he insisted that Vice President Harris still had more work to do to convince voters to support her. There are just 11 days until Election Day. Christie suggested that undecided voters still didn't ""know"" Harris and that she had failed to distinguish herself from President Biden and his policies. ""Ten days ago I would've told you that she's going to win. And I think she's had a bad ten days,"" he began. ""There’s advantages and disadvantages to coming into the race this late. The advantage is she didn’t have to go through all the primaries and go through all of that that goes on that wears you down a bit. But the disadvantage is people don’t know her,"" he said. ""She's been vice president for four years!"" co-host Sunny Hostin cut in. ""How could they not know her?"" Christie defended his comment by saying that the job of vice-president keeps you out of ""focus"" from the public, before co-host Joy Behar also interrupted. ""Why do they keep accusing her of doing nothing when she was vice president?"" Behar exclaimed. ""What did Mike Pence do?"" Christie went on to say that Harris needs to make clear to voters what she would do differently from President Biden, after she's struggled to answer this question in multiple interviews. This is an excerpt from an article by Kristine Parks.   Latino voters – a longstanding Democratic voting bloc – appear more likely to cast their ballot for former President Trump than Vice President Harris this election cycle, a recent poll shows. A new USA Today/Suffolk University poll taken among Latinos between October 14-18 saw Trump boasting an 11-point lead at 49% compared to Harris' 38% with a +/-9% margin of error. Despite Latino voters trending toward Democratic candidates in the past, Goya Foods CEO Bob Unanue isn't surprised. ""We are the No. 1 exploited community in the world,"" he told Fox News on Tuesday. ""The biggest industry that has flourished under this administration, under Kamala, has been drugs and human trafficking. Last year, Tara Lee Rodas testified that the U.S. is the middleman in this hundreds of billion-dollar business. She said there were 85,000 children missing…"" ""From 85,000, this year, they raised the amount of children lost or sold to 325,000 children. The Hispanic community, the Latino community is fed up with being exploited. They're fed up with high prices, and that's why you're seeing this community go head over heels toward Donald J. Trump."" Unanue, who leads America's largest Hispanic-owned food company that produces and distributes items in the U.S. as well as Spanish-speaking countries, has been critical of the Biden-Harris administration on multiple occasions — slamming their job performance on the economy and immigration, two prevailing issues this election cycle. This is an excerpt from an article by Taylor Penley.   Republican political analyst Ford O’Connell said recent decisions by major newspapers to refrain from endorsing presidential candidates, including the liberal-leaning Washington Post, show the race is ""slipping away"" from Vice President Kamala Harris. ""Trump is firing on all cylinders and he's outworking Kamala Harris at every turn on the campaign trail,"" O'Connell said on ""Fox & Friends Weekend."" ""And frankly, he's going up in all the polls,"" O'Connell added. The GOP strategist pointed out that Trump is leading in the Real Clear Politics average of polls in all seven key battleground states, with his strongest polling in sun belt states including North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona. ""Obviously, he's going to have to pick off one of the blue wall states, whether it's Pennsylvania, Michigan or Wisconsin. Right now, it appears that Harris is leading in the early vote in Pennsylvania. But let me tell you, it's going to be really, really close in all three of those states. But I do think the momentum is on Trump's side.""   Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) CEO Dana White are just some of the names expected to speak at former President Trump’s much-anticipated rally at New York City’s Madison Square Garden (MSG) on Sunday. ""The World's Most Famous Arena"" is expected to be packed with Trump supporters as the Republican nominee returns to his ""deep blue"" home state as his campaign enters its final days with increasing momentum. MSG is a 19,500-seat venue. The Trump campaign says the program includes political icons, celebrities, musical artists, and friends and family of former President Trump who will all discuss how he is ""the best choice to fix everything that Kamala Harris broke."" ""This epic event, in the heart of President Trump's home city, will be a showcase of the historic political movement that President Trump has built in the final days of the campaign,"" the campaign said in a press release. Musk has already hit the campaign trail for Trump, delivering a memorable speech in Butler, Pennsylvania, earlier this month, when the former president returned to the same site where an assassination attempt was made on his life on July 13. White, who has been a close friend of Trump for years and played a role in him reestablishing the mixed martial arts company in the early 2000s, introduced the former president at this year’s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, telling the crowd the stakes have never been higher. Other notable attendees this Sunday include former Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, political commentator Tucker Carlson and former Democrat presidential nominee turned Republican Tulsi Gabbard. High-profile names from the political world include Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance, Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. Republican National Committee Co-Chair Lara Trump as well as the former president’s sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. will also feature. From the music world, Death Row Records founder Michael Harris Jr. is set to appear, as will singer Lee Greenwood and opera singer Christopher Macchio. This is an excerpt from an article by Michael Dorgan.   The Harris-Walz campaign rolled out a new TV and digital ad on Saturday linking former President Trump to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II and other acts of anti-Asian hate. In the 30-second ad, titled, ""Our America,"" the Harris campaign accuses Trump of having an ""outdated vision of America"" that ""has no place"" for Asian Americans. The ad features symbols of American freedom, including the Constitution, purportedly ""under attack by Trump and his extremist allies,"" the Harris campaign said in a news release. The ad ""alludes to moments when Asian Americans were denied their civil rights – such as the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II and the 1982 murder of Vincent Chin in Detroit,"" the campaign said. It concludes with a call to action to defend democracy by voting for Harris. “The choice for Asian American voters in this election couldn’t be clearer. While Trump surrounds himself with loyalists to emulate the dictators he admires and intends to wield unchecked power to serve himself, Vice President Kamala Harris has only ever had one client: the people,” said Harris-Walz 2024 Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander spokesperson Andrew Peng. “This November, we have the power to protect our freedoms and elect a president who believes in the aspirations of our communities – and will never view us as ‘other.’”   Early voting has hit record levels in battleground Georgia, where elections officials say the vote count has already exceeded more than half of 2020's total turnout. “So over 50% of the turnout for 2020 has already voted in Georgia,” said Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer for the secretary of state's office. ""So for people like Joe Biden & Stacey Abrams, you were wrong saying we had voter suppression here. It’s easy to register & vote in Georgia…and really hard to even try to cheat. Great job by our voters & counties."" More than 2.6 million people in the Peach State have voted early, according to Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's office. The total vote count in the 2020 election was barely under 5 million. former President Trump narrowly lost the state to President Biden by a margin of just 11,779 votes.   Gov. Brian Kemp signed an overhaul of Georgia's election rules into law in 2021, after Trump made unproven claims of widespread voter fraud that purportedly cost him the state's 16 electoral votes in the last presidential election. Republicans said that new restrictions on absentee and mail-in voting, expanded voter ID requirements and prohibitions on non-poll workers from providing food and drink to voters waiting in line at poll centers were necessary to preserve election integrity. Democrats lambasted the changes, accusing GOP lawmakers of failing to back their claims about voter fraud with evidence and using the issue as a cover to suppress votes in minority communities. Earlier this week, Raffensperger told Fox News Digital that early votes could top 4 million by Election Day. Early voting in Georgia runs through Nov. 1.  Podcast host Joe Rogan told former President Trump he has gotten so popular with Americans due to the ""wild s---"" he says. (Screenshots/The Joe Rogan Experience)  Joe Rogan and former President Trump discussed the Republican nominee's growing popularity with young voters, with Rogan noting how America's youth is ""rejecting a lot of this woke bulls--t."" ""Young people are tired of being yelled at and scolded. They're tired of these people that they think are mentally ill telling them what the moral standards of society should be today, and people are upset,"" observed Rogan. ""The rebels are Republicans now,"" he continued. ""Like, you want to be a rebel? You want to be punk rock? You want to, like, buck the system? You're a conservative now. That's how crazy – and then the liberals are now pro-silencing criticism. They're pro-censorship online. They talking about regulating free speech and then regulating the First Amendment. It's bananas to watch."" ""Joe, they come after their political opponents,"" Trump said. ""I've been investigated more than Alfonse Capone."" ""Well, the do,"" agreed Rogan. Trump went on to say that he could have put ""crooked"" Hillary Clinton in jail, but didn't. ""I respected that you didn't,"" said Rogan. ""Because what you said was it would be bad for the country."" ""No, I can't. I couldn't even imagine – You have, first of all, a secretary of state but more importantly, the wife of the president of the United States of America going into jail?"" said Trump.  HOUSTON, TEXAS, UNITED STATES - OCTOBER 25: US Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris delivers remarks on 'Reproductive Freedom' at Shell Energy Stadium in Houston, Texas, United States on October 25, 2024. (Photo by Kyle Mazza/Anadolu via Getty Images)  Vice President Harris told a cheering crowd of 30,000 in Houston that she will fight for ""reproductive freedom"" and accused pro-life Republicans of hypocrisy on the abortion issue. ""These same people who have argued that these Trump abortion bans are investments in women and children, do look at their record. They tend to be in states with the highest rates of maternal mortality in the country,"" Harris said. ""For decades, these extremist leaders, who have neglected prenatal care, maternity care and post-partum care and who now, after continuously failing to support women and children, are claiming to care about women and children – well, I have a question for them. Where have you been?"" Harris claimed Republicans who oppose abortion have also opposed expanding the child tax credit, blocked Democratic proposals that would have lowered child care costs for working parents and advocated for cuts to entitlement programs like WIC and SNAP for poor families. ""The hypocrisy abounds,"" she said.   The number one podcaster in America loves the fact that former President Trump has teamed up with independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. During a three-hour conversation on ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" the titular host asked Trump whether he is ""completely committed"" to having RFK Jr. serve in his administration. ""Oh, I am,"" Trump said. ""But the only thing I want to be a little careful about with him is the environmental. Because, you know, he doesn't like oil. I love oil and gas."" Trump said that Kennedy would be directed to ""focus on health, do whatever you want."" He also revealed that ""big Pharma"" has exerted pressure on him to disassociate from Kennedy. Kennedy is a leading voice in spreading skepticism about vaccines, conflicting with most doctors and scientists who say the benefits of inoculations outweigh rare potential side effects. He has also claimed pharmaceutical companies conspire to prevent health improvements because they profit from selling drugs to people with chronic illness.

The Trump campaign has been targeted by Chinese hackers via phones used by former President Trump and his running mate JD Vance, according to a report. (Ma Yue/VCG via Getty Images)  The U.S. government is investigating unauthorized access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by Chinese hackers, targets of which include the Trump and Harris campaigns. The campaigns have been informed of the potential breach of cellphones used by former President Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, and members of Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing sources familiar with the matter. ""After the FBI identified specific malicious activity targeting the sector, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) immediately notified affected companies, rendered technical assistance, and rapidly shared information to assist other potential victims,"" the FBI and CISA told Fox News Digital in a joint statement. The FBI and CISA said the investigation was ongoing and ""we encourage any organization that believes it might be a victim to engage its local FBI field office or CISA. Agencies across the U.S. Government are collaborating to aggressively mitigate this threat and are coordinating with our industry partners to strengthen cyber defenses across the commercial communications sector."" The hackers are believed to be connected to the Chinese government's intelligence services, The Journal reported. ""We are aware that a highly sophisticated nation-state actor has reportedly targeted several U.S. telecommunications providers to gather intelligence,"" telecommunications company Verizon said in a statement. ""Along with federal law enforcement, industry peers and third-party cyber experts, we are working to confirm, assess and remediate any potential impact. Verizon is committed to assisting law enforcement in this investigation.  Since this is an active investigation, we have no additional comment at this time."" The anonymous officials said that investigators are working to find out if any data was stolen from the campaigns, adding that other people in the U.S. government may have been targeted by the attackers. This is an excerpt from an article by Brie Stimson, David Spunt and Jake Gibson.   Former President Trump accused his opponent Vice President Kamala Harris
 of ""running a hate campaign"" against him Friday at a rally in Traverse City, Michigan. The Republican nominee took aim at Harris after she and other Democrats have repeatedly called him a ""fascist"" on the campaign trail. ""You know, I think they're calling me a dictator,"" Trump said. ""So they started off where I was a dictator. None of it worked. Then they went to: ‘He’s an evil genius.’ That didn’t work. Then they went: ‘He’s a dumb son of a bitch.’ That didn’t work. That didn’t last too long. Then they went back to the dictator stuff,” Trump said. “Those poor people, those poor lost souls – they're like lost souls. They're radical left lunatics, Democrats. And they all suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome at a level."" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., released a relatively rare joint statement on Friday, demanding Harris cease using ""dangerous rhetoric"" and reminding her of the two recent assassination attempts against Trump. But Harris has so far ignored her GOP critics and continues to warn of ""the danger and the threat that Donald Trump poses to America and the fact that he is unfit to serve"" on the campaign trail. Fox News Digital's Julia Johnson contributed to this update.   The co-founder of Death Row Records, one of the most recognizable and influential record labels in the music industry, spoke to Fox News Digital about why he recently decided to endorse former President Trump over VP Kamala Harris. ""It's about his track record,"" Michael ""Harry-O"" Harris told Fox News Digital about his decision to endorse Trump, who granted Harris clemency from a 33-year prison sentence that had seven years remaining on it as one of his last actions as president. ""The former president, while president, enacted some initiatives that speaks to my community specifically and other people as well."" Harris cited several examples of policies from the first Trump administration that he feels are in line with the goals of his organization, Community First Action, including permanent funding for HBCUs, opportunity zones promoting investment in low income neighborhoods, the First Step Act, and bipartisan legislation combating sickle cell anemia. Polls have increasingly shown that Trump has made significant inroads with the Black community and is expected by many to earn a historically strong share of those votes in November. Harris told Fox News Digital he believes it is due in part to voters trusting that Trump will keep his word, and a lack of movement from the Biden-Harris administration. ""People have more confidence that he will keep his word and I think it's kind of based on some of the same research that we did, that when somebody doesn't campaign on something but actually enacted laws . . . that wants to double down on what he did in the first administration,"" Harris said. ""I haven't heard that from the other side as much. I mean, what I've heard, I believe, frankly, came a little bit too late, too little, too late. And so, when it comes to a balancing act, and you have to make a decision, the critical decision that could affect your life and the life of your family, you have to go based on facts, and the facts are that for the last three and a half years, the previous, the present administration hasn't really focused on our community."" This is an excerpt from an article by Andrew Mark Miller.  CLARKSTON, GEORGIA - OCTOBER 24: Democratic presidential nominee, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, speaks during a campaign rally at the James R Hallford Stadium on October 24, 2024 in Clarkston, Georgia. Harris and Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump, continue campaigning in battleground swing states before the November 5 election. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)  Vice President Kamala Harris is far and away the frontrunner in the battle for campaign cash, an important indicator in presidential politics. According to the latest figures the two major party presidential campaigns filed with the Federal Election Commission, Harris hauled in $97 million during the first half of October. That far outpaced the $16 million former President Trump's campaign said it raised during the first half of this month. Both campaigns use a number of affiliated fundraisings committees to raise money. And when those are included, Trump narrowed the gap, but trailed $176 million to $97 million during the first two weeks of this month. The new filings also spotlight that the Harris campaign continues to vastly outspend the Trump campaign. During the first 16 days of October, the Democratic presidential nominee's campaign outspent Trump $166 million to $99 million, with paid media the top expenditure for both campaigns. However, Harris finished the reporting period with more cash in her coffers. As of Oct. 16, she had $119 million cash on hand, while Trump had $36 million. When joint fundraising committees are also included, Harris holds a $240 million to $168 million cash-on-hand advantage. This is an excerpt from an article by Paul Steinhauser.   Two major national polls conducted Sunday through Wednesday and released Friday indicate Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump are in a dead heat. Grabbing headlines first is a New York Times/Siena College survey indicating the Democratic Party and GOP presidential nominees are tied at 48%. That's a switch from a previous poll, earlier this month, when Harris held a slight three-point edge. A CNN survey had the candidates deadlocked at 47% among likely voters nationwide. Its previous poll from late September indicated the vice president had a razor-thin one-point margin. There were warning signs in the two surveys for both candidates, however. Harris lost her favorability advantage over Trump in both polls. After replacing President Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in July, the vice president's favorable ratings soared. But they've steadily eroded over the past month. Another red flag for Harris are polls indicating her support among Black voters is below Biden's levels in the 2020 election. For Trump, his support among White voters is on par with his standing in the 2020 election, when he lost the White House to Biden. And the former president still faces a healthy deficit to the vice president when it comes to being trustworthy and caring about people. While national polls are closely watched, the race for the White House is not based on the national popular vote. It's a battle for the states and their electoral votes. And the latest surveys in the seven crucial battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump and will likely determine whether Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election, are mostly within the margin of error. The latest Fox News national poll indicated Trump had a two-point edge, but Harris had a 6-point advantage among respondents questioned in all seven battleground states. This is an excerpt from an article by Paul Steinhauser.   With 10 days until Election Day, two new major national polls indicate Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump are in a dead heat in the race to succeed President Biden in the White House. With the clock quickly ticking, the two nominees and their running mates are fanning out across the key battleground states this weekend. Trump starts Saturday with a rally in Novi, Michigan, in suburban Detroit. Later in the day, he'll campaign in another of the crucial swing states — Pennsylvania — as he holds a rally in State College, home to Penn State University. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, the Republican vice presidential nominee, starts his day in Atlanta before holding campaign events in Erie and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Top Trump surrogates Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who ended his long-shot White House run and endorsed Trump, and former Democratic presidential candidate and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who days ago switched from an independent to a Republican, will team up for Trump in swing state North Carolina. And Elon Musk, the Tesla and Space X magnate who's the world's richest person, stumps for Trump in Pennsylvania. Harris on Saturday will team up with former first lady Michelle Obama, arguably the most popular Democrat in the country, at a get-out-the-vote rally in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The stop comes two days after the vice president shared the stage in suburban Atlanta with former President Obama. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, makes two stops in battleground Arizona Saturday, first in Window Rock and later in Phoenix. In a sign of just how important a role Pennsylvania is playing with its 19 electoral votes up for grabs, first lady Jill Biden campaigns for Harris in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, while progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a two-time runner-up for the Democratic nomination, stumps for Harris in Erie. This is an excerpt from an article by Paul Steinhauser. Live Coverage begins here"
