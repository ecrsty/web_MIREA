Israel launches wave of retaliatory airstrikes against its enemy Iran,Euronews                      with AP,"26/10/2024,1:45 GMT+217:24",Iran,"Iran’s military said the strikes targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces and caused 'limited damage,' without elaborating.","Israel attacked Iran with a series of pre-dawn airstrikes on Saturday in what it said was a response to the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired upon Israel earlier in the month. The Israeli military said its aircraft targeted facilities that Iran used to make missiles fired at Israel as well as surface-to-air missile sites. There was no immediate indication that oil or missile sites were hit — strikes that would have marked a much more serious escalation — and Israel offered no immediate damage assessment. Explosions could be heard in the Iranian capital, Tehran, though the Islamic Republic insisted they caused only “limited damage” and Iranian state-run media downplayed the attacks. The Iranian army said four soldiers were killed in Israeli strikes. It is possible that the number of dead may be higher as Iran seeks to downplay the attacks. The strikes risk pushing the arch-enemies closer to all-out war at a time of spiralling violence across the Middle East, where militant groups backed by Iran — including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — are already at war with Israel. “Iran attacked Israel twice, including in locations that endangered civilians, and has paid the price for it,” said Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari in a video statement. “We are focused on our war objectives in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. It is Iran that continues to push for a wider regional escalation.” The strikes marked the first time Israel's military has openly attacked Iran, which hasn't faced a sustained barrage of fire from a foreign enemy since its 1980s war with Iraq. It came as part of Israel's “duty to respond” to attacks on it from “Iran and its proxies in the region,” Hagari said. “The Israel Defence Forces has fulfilled its mission,” Hagari said. “If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond.” Israel offered no initial damage assessment. Iran’s state-run media acknowledged blasts that could be heard in Tehran and said some of the sounds came from air defence systems around the city. But beyond a brief reference, Iranian state television for hours offered no other details and even began showing what it described as live footage of men loading trucks at a vegetable market in Tehran in an apparent attempt to downplay the assault. A Tehran resident told The Associated Press that at least seven explosions could be heard in the first wave of attacks, which rattled the surrounding area. The resident spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. As explosions sounded, people in Tehran could see what appeared to be tracer fire light up the sky. Other footage showed what appeared to be surface-to-air missiles being launched. Iran closed the country’s airspace early on Saturday, and flight-tracking data analysed by AP showed commercial airlines had broadly left the skies over Iran, and across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Iran's move to quickly downplay the attack may offer an avenue for it not to respond, which could risk a further escalation. Meanwhile, in seemingly unrelated violence, an attack on an Iranian police convoy on Saturday in the country's restive southern province of Sistan and Baluchestan killed at least 10 officers, authorities said. Details remain scarce over the attack in Gohar Kuh, some 1,200 kilometres southeast of the Iranian capital, Tehran. Initially, reports simply described an attack by “miscreants” without more information. But shortly after, Iranian state media said 10 officers had been killed. The White House indicated that Israel’s strikes on Iran should end the direct exchange of fire between the two enemy countries, while warning Tehran of “consequences” should it respond. A senior White House official said the administration believed the Israeli operation should “close out” the direct military exchange between Israel and Iran, and said other allies were in agreement. United States President Joe Biden was updated throughout Israel's operation, the official said, while underscoring that the U.S. had no involvement in the attack. The official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said the Israeli operation “was extensive, it was targeted, it was precise.” U.S. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, about Israel’s strikes on military targets in Iran, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said late Friday. Austin reiterated that the U.S. was committed to its ally’s security and that Israel has a right to defend itself, though Washington was determined to prevent the conflict from expanding, the Pentagon press secretary said in a statement. Israel and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran to be its greatest threat, citing its leaders’ calls for Israel’s destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the country’s nuclear programme. During their years-long shadow war, a suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists and Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged, all in mysterious attacks blamed on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran has been blamed for a series of attacks on shipping in the Middle East in recent years, which later grew into the attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. Meanwhile, Syrian state news agency SANA reported ""barrages of missiles from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan and Lebanese territories targeted some military sites in the southern and central regions"" of Syria early on Saturday. It said Syria's air defences shot some missiles down, with no information immediately available on casualties. Iran has launched two ballistic missile attacks on Israel in recent months amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip that began with the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. That initial attack killed some 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage back to the seaside enclave. In the time since, more than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to Hamas-led local health officials."
Some elderly voters in rural Bulgaria can't reach polling stations,Kristiana Ivanova and Emma De Ruiter,"26/10/2024,15:08 GMT+215:23",Bulgaria,"In the small south-eastern town of Lisitsite, the largely elderly population has no easy way of accessing polling stations for the election on Sunday.","As Bulgarians prepare to vote for a new government on Sunday, residents in rural parts of the country have become disillusioned, and many don't plan to vote at all. In the rural town of Lisitsite, in the country's south, the less than 20 residents are not eager to vote. The town is so remote, many polling stations are hard to reach, and the residents have lost faith in their government to build better infrastructure. ""We have been asking for a road to this place for many years. I am 70 years old, since democracy came not one nail has been driven here, not one,"" says resident Mehmed Ahmed. Nestled in the hills of the Eastern Rhodopes, Lisitsite looks like a dream place to live, but the reality is different. The only way to reach it is by boat or through the neighbouring village of Shiroko Pole, by walking along a railway for nearly three kilometres. From there, the rope bridge leads to the village itself. Many people who live in Lisitsite are elderly, and don't see a point in voting.  ""People are walking with two walking sticks. Most of them are over 80 years old. Two or three years ago they used to go to vote, but now they can't go,"" says Ahmed. In Bulgaria's last election, in June, voter turnout stood at a record low, at just 34%. This Sunday's election is the seventh time people are voting for a new government in just three years. In 2020, mass anti-corruption protests in 2020 toppled a coalition government led by the centre-right GERB party. Since then, a series of elections have led to unstable coalitions led by multiple centrist and right-wing parties. Some observers have labelled the past few years as a period of ""revolving-door governments,"" which has led to considerable apathy amongst voters."
Western and regional leaders call on Iran to show 'restraint' after attack,"Daniel Bellamy

This must end now."" In a statement France's foreign ministry urged ""the parties to refrain from any escalation and action likely to aggravate the context of extreme tension prevailing in the region."" British prime minister Keir Starmer urged ""maximum restraint."" Meanwhile, in Washington DC, National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said the US was urging Iran ""to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation.” Israel said the airstrikes were a response to the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired upon it earlier in the month. The Israeli military said its aircraft targeted facilities that Iran used to make missiles fired at Israel as well as surface-to-air missile sites. There was no immediate indication that oil or missile sites were hit — strikes that would have marked a much more serious escalation — and Israel offered no immediate damage assessment. In a statement the EU said: ""The dangerous cycle of attacks and retaliations risks causing a further expansion of the regional conflict."" ""While acknowledging Israel’s right to self-defence, the EU calls on all parties to exercise utmost restraint to avoid an uncontrollable escalation, which is in no one’s interest."" Saudi Arabia was one of multiple countries in the region condemning the strike, calling it a violation of Iran's ""sovereignty and a violation of international laws and norms.” The kingdom’s foreign ministry said it rejected the escalation in the region and “the expansion of the conflict that threatens the security and stability of the countries and people of the region.” The United Arab Emirates ""strongly condemned"" the strikes according to a statement put out by its foreign ministry. Turkey meanwhile accused Israel of having “brought our region to the brink of a greater war” following its strikes on Iran. “Putting an end to the terror created by Israel in the region has become a historic duty in terms of establishing international security and peace,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It also called on the international community to take “immediate action to enforce the law and stop the Netanyahu government.” Iran-backed Hamas called the attack “an escalation targeting the region's security and its people's safety.” But Israel’s opposition leader said the strikes on Iran didn't go far enough. Yair Lapid criticised the decision to avoid “strategic and economic targets"" in the attack. ""We could and should have exacted a much heavier price from Iran,” Lapid wrote on X."
Which European universities and countries file the most patent applications?,Alessio Dell'Anna,"23/10/2024,9:34 GMT+217:06",Europe in Motion,A new study shows a growing contribution of universities to the continent's innovation ecosystem but laments the bloc's fragmentation is crippling the ability to turn high-level scientific research into economic competitiveness.,"A new report by the European Patent Observatory (EPO) shows that patent submissions across the continent are concentrated in just a few places. Half of all direct and indirect patent applications submitted with the European Patent Office between 2000 and 2020 - on a total of over 100,000 - came from only 5% of all European universities. France's University of Grenoble was the most active, with 3,348 submissions, followed by Zurich's ETH (2,219) and Munich's Technical University (2,183). Overall, submissions were the highest in Europe's most industrialised regions, says the report, ""where opportunities for collaboration and technology transfers with industry are greatest."" In terms of countries, Germany submitted the most patent applications (24.09%). France ranks second, (17.97%), followed by the UK, (12.26%), and Italy (6.61%). However, smaller countries like Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Belgium, Finland, The Netherlands, and Belgium have the highest number of academic patents per university on average. The most active sectors have been pharmaceuticals (24,944 applications), biotechnology (22,870), measurement (22,870) and analysis of biological materials (8,832). The overall number of applications by European universities has increased steadily in recent decades, from 6.2% of all European patent applications in 2000 to 10.2% in 2019. The report however highlights a fundamental paradox affecting the European economy: Over 20% of patents filed were not exploited commercially. The European advantage in academic research ""has not been necessarily converted into applied technological and economic performance, compared to other advanced economies"" says the document. ""This is what is referred to as the 'European paradox': The difficulties of transforming science into commercialisation in Europe, despite the global leadership of European universities"" - (almost a third of the world's top 100 universities are European, according to the Shanghai Rankings). ""The fact that 10% of startups with European academic patents are headquartered in the US highlights the ongoing difficulties in commercialising new technologies within the EU single market"", researchers say. The biggest issues are market and policy fragmentation, lack of funding in university research and a sort of overall ""anti-risk sentiment"". The diversity of national models in academic patenting poses another challenge, as most knowledge gets only transferred to the local national or regional ecosystem. Mario Draghi's recent report on European competitiveness, as well as Enrico Letta’s on the Single Market's future, argued that such a fragmented ecosystem is to blame for Europe’s struggle in translating innovation into commercialisation. ""Nevertheless, the additional transaction costs tied to multiple national frameworks, and the ability of a few large companies to overcome these barriers by sourcing technology across borders, suggest there is potential for further harmonisation and integration in Europe’s markets for academic inventions."""
Would Donald Trump’s trade tariffs hurt Europe?,Mared Gwyn Jones,"24/10/2024,9:16 GMT+225/10/2024,12:58 GMT+2",EuroVerify,"The EU is increasingly reliant on the US export market, making it vulnerable to the potential shocks of Trump’s trade policy.","Donald Trump has a trade trick up his sleeve that he insists he’s not afraid to use if re-elected in November: a universal tariff of up to 20% on all foreign-imported products. “Outside of love and religion, it's the most beautiful word there is: tariff,” Trump told a North Carolina rally on Monday. A tariff is a tax levied on foreign goods as they enter a country, with the domestic importer expected to foot the bill, at least on paper. Trump has threatened to levy a 60% duty on Chinese products and up to 200% on cars produced in bordering Mexico. The Republican hopeful is counting on the trade tool to propel homegrown US businesses, create jobs and shrink the federal deficit through extra tax revenues. But his critics at home are warning that the economic burden of such tariffs could be passed on to American consumers, while allies abroad — including in Europe — fear the collateral damage of Trump’s tariffs could be devastating. The EU-US trading relationship is the most valuable in the world, worth around €1 trillion in goods and services annually. The EU benefits most from trade in goods, posting a surplus of €156 billion last year alone, against a deficit in services of €104 billion. A blanket tariff of 10% or 20% would make it more expensive for American companies to import EU goods, meaning EU exports across the Atlantic could plunge by as much as a third in some sectors, according to the most radical economic estimates. Sectors such as machinery, vehicles and chemicals — which together made up 68% of EU exports to the US last year — would be hardest hit. It would make Germany, the European bloc’s economic powerhouse, especially vulnerable to shocks, given its reliance on US exports in these sectors. While economists disagree on the extent of the damage, most agree Trump's tariffs would deal a devastating blow to Europe's economy. An across-the-board tariff of 10% would lower the eurozone’s GDP by 1%, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. More radical predictions say Trump's tariffs would make eurozone growth 1.5% lower by 2028. Such a scenario would push the economy — which is already under pressure — to the brink of a recession. Other economists estimate that a 10% tariff could at worst slice off up to 1.6% of Germany’s GDP, while the impact on other major economies such as Spain would be considerably lower at 0.5%. The after-shocks could also include job losses. Transatlantic trade and investment is estimated to directly support around 9.4 million jobs in both the EU and the US, according to European Commission estimates. But the bloc has been reinforcing its trade defence arsenal in recent years, including in response to the steep tariffs imposed by Trump on €6.4 billion in EU steel and aluminium during his first presidency. The trans-Atlantic trade truce that temporarily resolved that Trump-era dispute is due to expire on March 21, 2025, just two months before the next US administration takes office. Trump's vow to slap a 60% tariff on Chinese imported goods poses a real risk the EU could be dragged into an all-out trade war. “A tariff on Chinese goods entering the US would inevitably cause many products to be redirected to the European market,” André Sapir, a senior fellow at Bruegel and former economic advisor to European Commission President Romano Prodi, told Euronews. “The EU would need to respond to that with retaliatory measures. It would need to protect itself.” It could see trade tensions between Brussels and Beijing, which have escalated after an EU decision to impose steep tariffs on China-made electric vehicles, flare up even more. “The EU hasn't been doing what the US has in terms of decoupling from China and reducing imports. This is one of the few things that's been keeping the European economy afloat,” Zach Meyers, assistant director at the Centre for European Reform (CER), explained. “But how long will the US continue to allow Europe to straddle both horses at the same time? I think it’s a difficult question,” he added. The bloc would likely look to strike a deal with Trump before opting for retaliatory tariffs, analysts say. “The EU and others will be keen to offer Trump a carrot, something to give him the facade of saying that he's gotten away with a huge success,” Meyers said. “This is exactly what we saw under the Trump presidency, where you had both the Commission President and Chinese leaders signing these agreements to buy up American goods.” Trump’s own economic advisors could consider limiting his tariff ambitions to avoid potential economic turmoil at home. Economists say the move would inevitably lead to a spike in inflation and that US importing firms could decide to pass on the cost of tariffs to American citizens."

After the Israeli strikes what will Iran do next?,Babak Kamiar,"26/10/2024,11:57 GMT+212:58",Iran,The Iranian government said on Saturday morning that the damage from the airstrikes was 'limited' and that the 'situation is normal.',"After Israel launched a wave of airstrikes against Iran, domestic media and sources close to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) are attempting to downplay it, saying it was a failure. While Israel reports that at least 20 military sites were effectively targeted in a three-phase operation early on Saturday, Iranian semi-official sources have dismissed claims of 140 Israeli fighter jets being involved as “exaggerated Israeli propaganda.” They are also emphasising to Iranians that Israeli leaders directed the attack from bunkers, purportedly out of fear of potential Iranian retaliation. Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokeswoman for the Iranian government, limited her statement on the damage from the airstrikes, saying it was “limited” and that the “situation is normal.” The regime is also trying to stop photo and video of the damage from the airstrikes reaching the outside world. The Organised Crime Investigation Centre, a subdivision of the IRGC, issued a statement warning Iranian not to cooperate with foreign media, or else face a ten year prison sentence: ""Citizens are informed that any sending of images or news to opposition media or those affiliated with the Zionist regime is considered a crime."" But despite this threat, videos and images of the attack on Israel were shared on social media. As Washington had desired, Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu appears to have opted for a more limited series of retaliatory strikes on conventional military targets. Nuclear facilities and oil installations had been seen as possible targets for Israel’s response to Iran’s Oct. 1 attack, before U.S. President Joe Biden's administration won assurances from Israel in mid-October that it would not hit such targets, which would be a more severe escalation. The United States has now warned against further retaliation, indicating that the overnight strikes should end the direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran. In reality, Israel’s focus on specific military targets, whilst not ideal for the Islamic Republic, was far from the worst-case scenario. A more extensive attack on critical infrastructure—such as oil, electricity, or nuclear facilities—could have driven Iran into even deeper crisis amid the current economic and political instability. US media had earlier noted that if Israel’s response remained limited, Iran would likely refrain from retaliating. The New York Times also reported that Iranian officials have clarified they would respond if Israel’s attacks caused extensive damage and high casualties; however, if Israel kept its strikes to a few military bases and storage facilities for missiles and drones, Iran might opt not to take any counter-action. Iran finds itself in a precarious position, particularly as its regional proxy forces, notably Hezbollah in Lebanon, are significantly weakened.  The regime is aware, at least behind the scenes, that it lacks the military capability to match Israel, which receive billions of euros' worth of US military aid each year. While it is improbable that Iran would officially renounce its right to retaliate, an immediate response does not appear to align with its strategic interests. In the short term, Iranian media and state television will likely emphasise a narrative of “victory” while downplaying or even dismissing some aspects of Israel's retaliatory strike as “fake.” The Iranian regime will likely conceal any damage to ballistic missile production facilities or drone manufacturing plants, capitalising on the limited and perhaps coordinated nature of Israel’s response to control the situation. Of course, concealing the truth is nothing new in Iranian politics, with many examples like the downing of the Ukrainian airplane or Israel's response to Iran's first attack on Israeli soil in April 2024. Regarding Israel’s attack on the Isfahan facility, only a few days ago and for the first time, a senior IRGC commander finally acknowledged the occurrence of this strike. While Iran is expected to maintain the rhetoric of a potential response, it will likely navigate a delicate balance between escalating and de-escalating tensions. Moreover, it is essential to remember that the upcoming U.S. election, less than ten days away, will significantly influence the future policies of both Iran and Israel, and it seems unlikely that the White House would allow tensions to spiral in the remaining days—a prospect that could prompt Iran to shelve the issue for now—a restraint possibly hinted at by Iran’s implicit assurance to stabilise Lebanon and Gaza, which could encourage Tehran to keep the matter quiet. However, the influence of those who benefit from sanctions and the hardliners within Iran’s ruling circles, who see full-scale conflict as their only path to political survival, should not be underestimated either."
At least 126 dead or missing in massive flooding and landslides in Philippines,"Daniel Bellamy
                  with AP","26/10/2024,17:48 GMT+2",Philippines,The number of dead and missing in massive flooding and landslides wrought by Tropical Storm Trami in the Philippines has reached nearly 130.,"President Ferdinand Marcos said on Saturday that many areas remained isolated and that rescue efforts were ongoing. Marcos, who inspected another hard-hit region southeast of Manila on Saturday, said the unusually large volume of rainfall dumped by the storm — including in some areas that saw one to two months’ worth of rainfall in just 24 hours — overwhelmed flood controls in provinces lashed by Trami. ""The water was just too much,” Marcos told reporters. “We’re not done yet with our rescue work,” he said. “There are still many areas that remained flooded and could not be accessed even big trucks."" His administration, Marcos said, would plan to start work on a major flood control project that can meet the unprecedented threats posed by climate change. Trami blew away from the north-western Philippines on Friday, leaving at least 85 people dead and 41 others missing in in one of the Southeast Asian archipelago’s deadliest and most destructive storms so far this year, the government’s disaster-response agency said. The death toll was expected to rise as reports come in from previously isolated areas. Dozens of police, firefighters and other emergency personnel, backed by three backhoes and sniffer dogs, dug up one of the last two missing villagers in the lakeside town of Talisay in Batangas province Saturday. A father, who was waiting for word on his missing 14-year-old daughter, wept as rescuers placed the remains of one person in a black body bag. Distraught, he followed police officers, who carried the body bag down a mud-strewn village alley to a police van. The man said he was sure it was his daughter, but authorities needed to do checks to confirm the identity of the villager dug up in the mound. In a nearby basketball gym at the town centre, more than a dozen white coffins were laid side by side, bearing the remains of those found in the heaps of mud, boulders and trees that cascaded Thursday afternoon down the steep slope of a wooded ridge in Talisay's Sampaloc village. More than five million people were in the path of the storm, including nearly half a million who mostly fled to more than 6,300 emergency shelters in several provinces, the government agency said. In an emergency Cabinet meeting, Marcos raised concerns over reports by government forecasters that the storm — the 11th to hit the Philippines this year — could make a U-turn next week as it is pushed back by high-pressure winds in the South China Sea. It was forecast to batter Vietnam over the weekend, if it doesn't veer off course. The government had shut down schools and government offices for the third day on Friday to keep millions of people safe on the main northern island of Luzon. Inter-island ferry services were also suspended, stranding thousands. Weather has cleared in many areas on Saturday, allowing clean-up work in most areas. Each year, about 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines, a Southeast Asian archipelago which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing and flattened entire villages."
Daylight saving ends in Europe this weekend. Experts warn the time change could harm your health,Imane El Atillah,"26/10/2024,10:30 GMT+214:37",Health news,"Most of Europe will end daylight saving time this weekend, turning clocks back by one hour. But what are the potential health impacts of this practice?","Clocks in multiple countries in Europe will move back one hour early on Sunday, marking the end of daylight saving time. This seasonal time shift happens twice a year, switching to daylight saving time (DST) in the spring, when clocks move forward one hour, and returning to standard time in the fall. Although the clock change has been a standardised practice for years and is common in most of Europe and the United States, and parts of Canada, Australia, and Latin America, health experts warn it may be harmful to people’s well-being. Earlier this week, a team of sleep researchers from the British Sleep Society published a position statement urging the UK government to abolish the twice-yearly clock changes. The statement, published in the Journal of Sleep Research, advocates for adopting standard time year-round as it aligns more closely with “the natural light-dark cycles of the day and night”. “Restoring permanent Standard Time would mean our clocks would be closely aligned to solar time, and while it would mean earlier sunsets in the summer, there would be additional benefits to health from improved sleep and circadian alignment due to increased exposure to morning sunlight from autumn to spring,” Malcolm von Schantz, professor of chronobiology at Northumbria University and a member of the Northumbria Centre for Sleep Research, said in a statement. The researchers added that maintaining a good sleep routine and exposure to natural daylight in the morning are important components of human health and disruptions to either of these factors could lead to negative health effects. “If you aren't getting that morning light exposure then you're not regulating your body clock as well as you could be, and there's really sort of a specific time in the morning that you need that light exposure in order to help regulate your body clock, and that allows you to fall asleep early enough at night,” Dr Megan Crawford, senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Strathclyde and lead author of the statement, told Euronews Health. “If you're not doing that, you're kind of burning the candle at both ends, and then you're losing that sleep at night, you're getting poor quality of sleep, and poor quality sleep is linked to a lot of health outcomes, mental health as well as physical health,” she added. One main reason the experts provide in favour of discontinuing seasonal time change is its impact on the human circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is the body’s biological clock, which operates on a 24-hour cycle, and according to the researchers, plays a role in regulating essential bodily functions, including sleep, hormone release, metabolism, and mood. The disturbances that come from gaining or losing an hour of sleep interfere with the natural sleep cycle and affect these functions. Crawford explained that while the time change ""doesn't really make a difference"" in summer, when sunrises are still very early, the same isn’t true in other seasons. “In spring and autumn, the sunrise is a little bit later, so by getting up an hour earlier we may be getting up in the dark. And that's really problematic because we need morning sunlight in order to regulate our body clocks and for optimal sleep,” she said. Well-timed light exposure keeps the circadian cycle aligned to the 24-hour day as the morning light promotes natural waking and enables early sleep onset in the evening, the statement said. However, exposure to light at night, which could happen during time shifts, makes it harder to fall asleep and wake up on time. Multiple scientific studies have also found evidence of increased adverse health consequences following the time shift. For instance, a meta-analysis based on seven studies involving more than 100,000 participants found that there was a significantly higher risk of heart attacks, in the weeks following spring and autumn DST transitions. Another study by researchers in Finland found that hospitalisations for stroke increased in the first two days following the time change. Research has also linked it to rises in mental health issues and mood disturbances, especially in vulnerable individuals, including an increase in suicide rates in the weeks following the start of daylight saving time. Crawford attributed the resistance to ending time changes to a “lack of understanding,” emphasising that the benefits of extended evening daylight in the summer would remain, regardless of whether DST is used. ""A lot of people think that Daylight Saving Time gives them more sunlight or more daylight, but that won't change. The sun won't change just because we're changing our schedules"". In 2018, the European Commission proposed ending the twice-yearly clock shifts in the European Union. As part of the proposal, it also conducted an online consultation to determine the views of EU residents on the topic. Support for ending the clock changes was significant, with rates ranging from as high as 95 per cent in Poland and Finland to 44 per cent in Greece. The responses showed that an overwhelming majority of respondents favoured putting an end to the practice, with an average of 84 per cent of people across the EU supporting the change. However, while the European Parliament voted in favour of adopting the change, the European Council has not agreed to it, and DST transitions have continued."

Israeli airstrike killed journalists covering the war in Lebanon as they slept,Euronews                      with AP,"26/10/2024,1:06 GMT+2",Lebanon,The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was appalled by the killing of the three journalists and called for an independent investigation.,"An Israeli airstrike hit guesthouses where journalists were staying in southeast Lebanon on Friday, killing three media staffers from two different news agencies according to Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency. It was a rare airstrike on an area that has been used by the media as a base for covering the war. The airstrike turned buildings used by media outlets covering the war into rubble with cars marked “PRESS” being overturned and covered in dust and debris. The Israeli army did not issue a warning prior to the strike, which it said targeted Hezbollah militant infrastructure. The military later said the strike was being reviewed. Several journalists have been killed since a near-daily exchange of fire began along the Lebanon-Israel border on October 8, 2023. Lebanon’s health ministry says the total toll over the past year is over 2,500 killed and 12,000 wounded with 1.2 million Lebanese people reportedly driven from their homes, including 400,000 children, according to the United Nations. Two people in Israel died of their wounds after a rocket attack from Hezbollah militants in Lebanon on Friday, the country’s rescue services said. Rocket shrapnel hit the Israeli town of Majd Al-Krum, with a further seven people being injured. Militants in Lebanon fired 45 projectiles into Israel on Friday. Some were intercepted by Israel’s air defences whilst others reportedly fell into open areas. Earlier on Friday, Israeli attack on the Gazan city of Khan Younis left at least 38 people dead. The strikes came a day after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Israel had accomplished its objective of “effectively dismantling” Hamas and urged both sides to resume negotiations. During his visit to Qatar, he expressed hope for the revival of ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas in the coming days. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians according to local health authorities."
At least one killed and several injured after Russian drone attack on residential Kyiv building,Euronews,"26/10/2024,0:07 GMT+2",Ukraine,Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said a teenage girl was killed in the late-night Russian attack.,"At least one person was reportedly killed and five injured after a Russian drone hit a 25-story residential building in Kyiv on Friday night. Emergency responders were dispatched to the site of the attack to fight a fire which broke out on the upper floor of the building due to the strike. The fire was extinguished but a search and rescue operation continued, according to Kyiv’s major Vitali Klitschko. Klitschko said one of the five injured was sent to hospital and that a first aid tent was set up at the site. Ukraine’s Emergency Service say the attack damaged several apartments in the building with around 100 people being evacuated after the drone struck. “Apartments from the 17th to the 21st storeys were damaged in the apartment building in Solomyanskyi district,” Serhiy Popko, head of the Ukrainian capital’s military administration wrote on Telegram, “Apartments were on fire on the 20th floor.” Prior to the attack, local media report an air alert had been sounded in Kyiv and other Ukrainian regions due to a mass Russian drone attack – a near-daily occurrence in Ukraine for over a month. Air defence units were reportedly deployed during the hour-long air raid alert."
Revealed: These were the 10 best companies to work for in Europe in 2024,Imane El Atillah,"26/10/2024,12:38 GMT+212:39",Work,Fortune has released its 2024 list of 100 best companies to work for in Europe. Which ones made the top 10 and why did employees rate them so highly?,"When it comes to professional work, Europe is recognised for having one of the most favourable approaches globally. European countries consistently rank among the best for work-life balance, were some of the first to trial the four-day workweek, and offer some of the highest average salaries in the world, along with other employee benefits. But which companies on the continent are the best to work for? Fortune and Great Place To Work have published the ""Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For Europe"" list, which was compiled by analysing more than 1.3 million survey responses from over 2 million employees across Europe. The companies that topped the list had employees who were both more motivated to work and more comfortable with their company's way of working. For instance, according to a blog by Great Place To Work, their market study found that, in high-ranking companies, nearly 90 per cent of workers reported that they put in extra effort to get the job done, compared to only 59 per cent at a typical European workplace. They also found that camaraderie was a driving factor, with workers being 108 per cent more likely to give extra effort if they felt a sense of cooperation with their colleagues. Moreover, 86 per cent of employees at these top workplaces expressed plans to stay long-term, compared to just 60 per cent at other workplaces, which was particularly relevant among those who felt their work was meaningful and provided them with a sense of purpose. Also the report found that innovation rates were 66 per cent higher at the top workplaces and were mainly driven by continuous training and development opportunities the companies were providing. Here’s a look at the 10 best companies to work for in Europe according to the latest Fortune listing. Work-life balance was also a key factor behind the higher rankings of companies and one of the aspects that workers valued most. A high percentage of workers, about 85 per cent, who work at one of the best companies, said they were encouraged to maintain a balance between their work and personal lives, with 92 per cent reporting that they were able to take time off when necessary. Fairness in the workplace also played a significant role and contributed to the higher rankings of some companies. Employees at those companies reported that promotions were fair (78 per cent), they received a fair share of company profits (70 per cent), and their managers did not play favourites among their staff (81 per cent). This sense of fairness was also linked to employees' willingness to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) tools in their work. Only around one in three respondents (34 per cent) from the whole European study said they were excited to use AI to improve their work; the report also found that those who believed their companies were fair were 29 per cent more likely to be excited to use AI tools. While European workers are still reluctant to adopt AI, the technology sector in general is not a dominant force in Europe when it comes to jobs. This contrasts with the US, where tech companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google are among the best and have emerged as early winners in the AI boom. In Europe, however, many of the leading companies are from more traditional industries such as fossil fuels, automotive, and finance, as shown in the recent Fortune 500 list. Topping the list, Europe’s biggest company was German car manufacturer Volkswagen, followed by two oil and gas companies, Britain’s Shell and France’s TotalEnergies. According to Fortune, while only 15 companies in this year’s list are from the tech sector, legacy businesses are also opening the door to innovation by adopting automation technologies. For instance, Volkswagen announced earlier this year the integration of AI chatbot ChatGPT into the voice assistant in some of its vehicles. Additionally, the fossil fuel company Shell has also embraced the use of AI in its operations, like using AI-based technology in deep-sea exploration and production, with the aim of improving operational efficiency, speeding up processes, and increasing production."
"The best things to do, hear, see or watch in Europe this week",Amber Louise Bryce,"26/10/2024,9:40 GMT+2",Culture news,"Exhibitions from Tim Burton and Superflat supremo Mr., Venom returns to cinemas and new album releases from the Pixies and Laura Marling - here's what to consume in Europe this (extra spooky) week.","Happy Halloween, guys and ghouls [insert maniacal laugh]. Ok, so it's technically not Halloween yet, but seeing as this is the last digest before the year's spookiest evening, we're bringing you a special edition tinged with terror and terrible puns. Fans of Tim Burton have a lot to scream about, with the final stop of his world-touring exhibition arriving in London. Also in London - a fantastic new show by the artist Fin DAC that celebrates his creative influences (although it ends 26 October, so be quick!) Elsewhere, Dutch Design Week continues, while a groundbreaking new retrospective in Venice focuses on Op Art pioneer Marina Apollonio. If you'd prefer to hide away in the cinema, we'd recommend Smile 2 for some seasonal scare-themed viewing - or there's the newly released Venom: The Last Dance for pure escapism. Whether you're heading to a costume party, carving pumpkins or just turning off all the lights and tucking into toffee apples, have a lovely weekend - filled with treats only. ‘The World of Tim Burton’ at the Design Museum (London, UK) Nothing says “it’s showtime” on spooky season like a Tim Burton exhibition. From Beetlejuice to Edward Scissorhands to Corpse Bride to so many more, the filmmaker has crafted some of modern cinema's most iconic and idiosyncratic movies, defined by their unique kooky goth aesthetic. Fresh off his most recent release, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Burton has leant his personal archive of drawings, paintings, photographs, sketchbooks, set and costume designs, and more to London’s Design Museum. This vast and varied exhibition explores the evolution of a creator's aesthetic, tracing Burton’s personal life through to his modern day career. It’s an absolute must-see for fans - and also the final showing of what has been a decade-long world touring exhibit, ending 21 April 2025. Marina Apollonio: ‘Beyond the Circle’ at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection (Venice, Italy) The Italian artist Marina Apollonio has always understood the shape of things to come, a pivotal figure in the Op Art and kinetic art movements of the 60s. Her spiralling geometric designs that swallow your sight with optical illusion have become defining pieces of 20th century art, given major recognition after American art collector Peggy Guggenheim commissioned a piece in 1968. Coming full circle, it’s appropriate then that this retrospective of Apollonio’s works now be on show at the Peggy Guggenheim Collective. Hundreds of paintings, sculptures, drawings, chromatic experimentations and more contextualise Apollonio’s career from 1963 to the present day. For those in the know and newbies alike, it’s a fantastic way to experience such influential art while learning about the artist behind it all. On until 3 March 2025. Mr.: 'Those that Bring Color to Life and Living' at Lehmann Maupin's Cork street pop-up (London, UK) Best known for his Superflat style involving shaped-canvas paintings infused with anime and manga, Japanese artist Mr. is a former protégé of Takashi Murakami, concerned with exploring Japanese culture and its undercurrents of obsessiveness, commercialisations, consumerism and fetishisation. In this debut solo UK show, both print and motion works collaborate and contrast to create a contemporary contemplation of the circulation of pop culture imagery, its role in escapism and how it helped define postwar Japanese youth culture in particular. On until 16 November 2024. Venom: The Last Dance The sticky black liquid antihero is back for this third instalment in the Venom series, following 2018’s Venom and 2021’s Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Tom Hardy plays the pivotal role as Eddie Brock, the unfortunate host to our alien symbiote after it tried (and failed) to bond with Spiderman prior (remember Toby Maguire’s ‘dark spidey’ rizz in Spider-Man 3?) Picking up from the events of the last movie, in which the pair took on a red symbiote named Carnage, wrecked everything in the process (these poor city councils in superhero land, honestly) and went on the run from authorities. As with all Marvel films, expect sardonic quips, high-octane action and slimy special effects that bring this particular franchise to a fitting finale - for now. Three Kilometres to the End of the World Here’s a film festival gem you might not have heard of - and one that should definitely be on your watchlist. Directed by Emanuel Pârvu and set in a remote Romanian village, it’s an astute observation of a family caught in the throes of various struggles. Dragoi (Bogdan Dumitrache) is saddled with debt and then discovers his 17-year-old son Adi (Ciprian Chiujdea) is gay - something he responds to badly. What unfolds is a tense exploration of community-formed bubbles, and the ways in which their deeply embedded strictures and stigmas can tear us into two. Our reviewer David Mouriquand selected it as his Film of the Week and wrote: ""Trei kilometri până la capătul lumii (Three Kilometres to the End of the World), shows that the actor-turned-director is one of the brightest stars of the new wave of Romanian filmmaking."" Read his full review here. The Room Next Door Beginning its European rollout in Spain and now the UK and Germany, Almodóvar's first English-language feature film (and Golden Lion winner at Venice Film Festival) is a powerful portrait of life, death and the unbreakable bonds that help us to navigate it all. Based on Sigrid Nunez's novel, ""What Are You Going Through"", it focuses on the relationship between two old friends: Ingrid (Julianne Moore), an autofiction writer who is terrified of death, and Martha (Tilda Swinton) who has terminal cancer and makes the decision to end her life with a euthanasia pill. Powerful and pop-coloured, it’s an important watch buttressed by great lead performances, even if some of the emotional authenticity gets lost in translation at points. Read our full review here. ‘The Disappearance of Kimmy Diore’ (Disney+) Investigating the case of a kidnapped 6-year-old YouTuber named Kimmy, detective Sara Roussel (Géraldine Nakache) soon finds herself immersed in the seemingly superficial world of social media influencers, within which lurks a sinister underbelly of deception and conceit. Fresh feeling and highly bingeable, this French crime drama tackles a growing topic of concern: the exploitation of child ""influencers"" who are managed by their parents - and its potentially catastrophic effects. 'Rivals' (Disney+) Is it just us or is it warm in here? Another TV recommendation from Disney+ — and it's a steamy one. Based on a 1988 novel of the same name by Jilly Cooper, this raucous romp of a show centres on a rivalry between Rupert Campbell-Black (Alex Hassell) and media mogul Lord Tony Baddingham (David Tennant), all set to the hot and heavily hair-sprayed garish kitsch of the 80s. The cast is stacked, also featuring Katherine Parkinson, Danny Dyer and Emily Atack, but the main pull is all the sexy bits (and there are many), providing pure soapy silliness that comes together (literally) as the perfect bed-rot-and-soul-cheer viewing. Laura Marling: ‘Patterns in Repeat’ Laura Marling is one of those rare singers that can capture such gentle folky warmth with sharp poetic profundities in her music. First discovered as a teenager, Marling has gone on to produce eight studio albums, with 'Patterns in Repeat' being her newest - following the 2020 release of 'Song for Our Daughter'. In the time between the two, she gave birth to her daughter, writing music about the experience of motherhood and personal revelations that have come with it. The sound is awash with silky emotion and lulling melodies that give you goosebumps. Read our full review here. Pixies: ‘The Night the Zombies Came’ It's difficult to remain cool - especially if you're a defining band of the 90s alt-rock scene, enshrined in a specific period of success that harshens and heightens attempts to evolve outside of it. Unfortunately for the Pixies, this trope has proven true, with much of their album releases since reuniting in 2004 proving unmemorable and critically dismissed. Their latest - the appropriately Halloweeny titled 'The Night the Zombies Came' - feels like a return to more familiar ground and trademark haunted sound; moody surf rock for vibing out in cigarette butt-strewn basements. Lady Gaga: 'Disease' ‘Little Monsters’ (the name for Lady Gaga fans FYI) will be roaring with excitement as the singer has released the first single from her upcoming album (rumoured to be called 'Nightingale'). It's her first pop single in a while, with 2020's 'Chromatica' being the last and two jazz records following: 2021's 'Love for Sale' and her recently release companion piece to Joker: Folie à Deux, 'Harlequin'. To be fair, she's been busy - but the good news is, Gaga's return to dark dance-pop screams with haunted house party fun - and is much more likely to inspire ""a happy face"" than Joker 2."
The year of elections: What can Trump learn from Europe as he fights for Gen-Z voters?,Boyd Wagner,"25/10/2024,18:26 GMT+226/10/2024,9:43 GMT+2",World,"National Rally and AfD, once unacceptable to young voters, have managed to reach them and win them over with savvy social media strategies.","It's been dubbed ""the year of the election"". Throughout 2024, democracies across the west have seen millions of voters cast votes already this year — and on 5 November, the world’s oldest continuously operating democracy, the US, will elect a president, the entire House of Representatives and one-third of its Senate. With many of the same issues attracting the focus of politicians, parties and voters on both sides of the Atlantic, Euronews asks: What can Europe’s myriad elections in 2024 tell us about the upcoming vote in the US? This past April, as the European Parliament elections were ramping up, Germany’s 66-year-old chancellor, Olaf Scholz, created a TikTok account. After years of ignoring the fast-growing Chinese social media platform, the German leader joined TikTok in hopes of gaining support with Germany’s younger voters. “Go where the citizens are and inform them there,” was the rationale laid out by government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit. TikTok is the largest online platform for members of now-voting eligible Generation Z. More than 70% of “Zoomers” worldwide use TikTok, far outstripping the general population. And the platform has been key to the growth of various far-right parties throughout Europe, including Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) and France’s National Rally (RN). Keen to improve its image with Germany’s youth, AfD has worked tirelessly to become TikTok’s most active political party in Germany, and controversial party leaders including Maximilian Krah have gained large followings over the past year by posting short videos with a large reach. With June’s EU vote and a series of German state elections now in the rearview mirror, it appears the strategy worked. In June, AfD grew its share with voters 16-29 years old by 11 points compared to the 2019 EU elections — and in September’s regional election in Thuringia, 38% of voters under 25 years of age voted for AfD, more than double the result of the age group's second choice of party, Die Linke. In France, meanwhile, a similar rightward trend among young voters is coming into view. Marine Le Pen’s young protégé, RN leader Jordan Bardella, is another keen user of social media, and his profile was crucial to RN’s growth in 2024. With 2 million TikTok followers, Bardella is the third most followed French politician on the platform, trailing only President Emmanuel Macron (5 million) and left-wing firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon (2.6 million). But the devil is in the detail, and Bardella’s account has more likes and higher engagement rates than his competitors. Once viewed as too extreme to govern, RN has benefited from a combination of strategic rebranding as well as the age-old factor of time, and its relative successes in 2024 have clearly been bolstered by a surge in support among French youth. Despite the party’s controversial history and connections to past fascist movements, many young French voters see RN as an alternative to the status quo of Macron’s liberal coalition or the smattering of left-wing parties that comprised the National Popular Front in this summer’s parliamentary vote. In June’s EU elections, RN achieved a historic percentage of the youth vote en route to their largest-ever allotment of MEPs. Exit polls showed that the far-right party gobbled up 32% of the under-35-year-old vote, while Macron’s coalition achieved just 5% of it. In the subsequent snap election for French parliament, RN found similar success with voters under 35. Like AfD, RN achieved this success partially by tailoring social media messaging for younger audiences, a strategy that allowed them to structure their ideological messages in a way that connected to younger voters. In essence, TikTok became a tool to shape existing narratives into a message that connected with the issues plaguing many of Europe’s young people. One of AfD’s most common campaign themes over the past year has been “peace in Europe”. Critics in Germany and across Europe have lambasted the German party for being pro-Russian. Yet AfD’s leaders have successfully used TikTok and other social media platforms to argue that young people's lives are being made harder because Germany’s government and establishment parties are focusing instead on non-German issues such as Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. European-wide issues, such as the housing crisis, stagnant wages and poor job opportunities, were wrapped into a singular message that if peace in Europe can only be achieved, then young voters' immediate problems could be fixed. The same tactic was used to campaign on migration, which both AfD and RN connected to the many obstacles in young voters' lives. In 2019, climate change and environmental concerns drove many young European voters to support green and liberal parties across the EU. But while a study by the Institute for Global Affairs shows that environmental issues remain a top priority for younger voters, the lines are less clear than they were five years ago. Today, “poor decision-making by the political elite” has risen to become younger voters' second-biggest concern — followed by migration. This shift has presented a unique opportunity for Europe’s right, signalling that younger voters have become increasingly diverse in their priorities. It's not just France and Germany showing this trend. In the Netherlands, Greet Wilders and his Freedom Party increased the youth vote by 7% in their election win last year. In Portugal, far-right party Chega jumped to a comfortable third-place position in Lisbon’s Parliament, partially riding a social media-driven campaign geared towards younger voters upset with the establishment. Far-right parties from Spain to Finland have also enjoyed greater-than-normal levels of support from young voters. With establishment centrist or left-wing parties still in control in many capitals across Europe, including Brussels, the shift is unlikely to stop. If confidence continues to wane in Europe’s governments, far-right parties will continue to present an alternative for young voters seeking a change to the status quo. Citizens of the US face many of the same key issues as their counterparts in Europe, with housing costs, stagnant pay and inflation have all created major issues for younger voters. And US strategists on both sides of the aisle have recognised this. For the last 60 years, the US youth vote has reliably gone to the Democrats. In many elections, Democratic campaigns have depended on driving up the under-35 demographic to win narrow outcomes. That much was true in 2020, Joe Biden won the youth vote by a margin of 61-36 — an 11-point improvement on Hillary Clinton’s result in 2016. Given the narrowness of the 2020 result, high youth turnout for Biden arguably won him the election. This year looked more difficult. Before the president dropped out of the race in July, a smattering of polls conducted between May and July showed Biden still leading Trump among the youngest voters, but only by small margins; one PBS poll from June even showed Trump ahead of Biden when including other candidates, such as RFK Jr (now no longer running) and the Green Party's Jill Stein. The numbers were jarring for the Democrats, and may have played a role in convincing the president to step down from his re-election bid. Since accepting the Democratic nomination in the summer, Kamala Harris has made strides in recapturing young voters. A new CNBC poll shows that Harris is back to leading with voters under 34 by a 20% margin, 60%-40% — numbers more in line with the 2020 result. However, data for young voters tends to be more variable and less reliably predictive than with other demographics, and that has thrown up conflicting polling results. According to a September SurveyUSA poll, Trump held a four-point advantage with Gen-Z voters, beating Harris 50-46. And in the key swing state of Arizona, where Biden won an ultra-narrow victory in 2020, Harris is struggling with the youth demographic. A recent New York Times/Siena College poll found her leading Trump by just 9% with voters under 30 in the state — and the same poll put Trump ahead by 5 points in the state as a whole. The tightening youth vote shows an ongoing trend reminiscent of Europe. As young European men lead the shift right, the trend is even more noticeable in the US. While the US' young women remain strongly liberal, driven largely by the crucial issue of abortion rights, young men are growing more conservative. In 2022’s midterm elections, Gen-Z women voted Democratic at a 72% rate. In that same election cycle, Gen-Z men split almost evenly, with 52% voting for the Democrats. The Trump campaign sees the trend. In recent months, the former President has made guest appearances on an array of podcasts with audiences comprised largely of young men. This week, it was announced that Trump would be a guest on Joe Rogan’s podcast. Rogan is a culturally important figure, especially for many young men, with over 11 million listeners per episode. Still, the path to winning “Zoomers” remains an uphill battle for the Republicans. Unlike Europe’s left, Harris and the Democrats lead the battle on social media, especially TikTok. Despite major investments made by Trump’s campaign, the former president remains less popular there: negative-Trump posts on the platform outweigh negative-Harris posts by a 2-to-1 margin, according to Pew Research, while 55% of US TikTok users identify as Democrats and just 39% as Republicans. However, in an election that could come down to just a few thousand voters in a handful of states, every vote matters. And if the trend we saw in Europe continues in the US, Trump may only need to peel 5-15% of Gen-Z voters away from the left to shift the outcome in his favour. This is part two of a two-part series where Euronews explores the similarities between Europe and America’s 2024 elections. Read the first part on how European elections highlighted voter dissatisfaction and a shift towards anti-establishment parties, a trend that could influence the US elections, here."
Springsteen blasts Trump while Beyoncé expected at today’s Democrat rally in Texas,David Mouriquand,"25/10/2024,10:38 GMT+211:22",Culture news,"Beyoncé is reportedly heading to Houston to take part in today's rally for Kamala Harris. Last night, Bruce Springsteen played at a Harris rally in Atlanta, and called Trump a tyrant - echoing the recent comments made by General John Kelly, who said that Trump fits the definition of a fascist.","Following a greatest hits performance from Bruce Springsteen at Kamala Harris’ rally in Atlanta last night, only days after publicly endorsing her, Beyoncé is expected to appear today in her hometown of Houston at a rally for Harris. Harris' presidential campaign has taken on Beyonce's 2016 track 'Freedom' as its anthem, and the singer's planned appearance brings a high-level of star power to what has become a key theme of the Democratic nominee’s bid: freedom. Harris heads to the reliably Republican state today just 10 days before Election Day in an effort to refocus her campaign against Donald Trump on reproductive care. Harris’ Houston trip is set to feature women who have been affected by Texas' restrictive abortion laws, which took effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Harris has centered her campaign around the idea that Trump is a threat to American freedoms, from reproductive and LGBTQ rights to the freedom to be safe from gun violence. At yesterday’s rally, Springsteen slammed Donald Trump: “I want a president who reveres the Constitution, who does not threaten but wants to protect and guide our great democracy, who believes in the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power, who will fight for a woman’s right to choose, and who wants to create a middle-class economy that will serve all our citizens.” He added: “There is only one candidate in this election who holds those principles dear: Kamala Harris. She’s running to be the 47th president of the United States, Donald Trump is running to be an American tyrant. He does not understand this country, its history, or what it means to be deeply American. That’s why on November 5th, I’m casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.” Springsteen’s tyrant comment echoes deeply at the moment, especially after the recent comments made by General John Kelly, who served under Trump as his chief of staff. Kelly said in a New York Times interview that Trump fits the “general definition of a fascist” and confirmed the Republican candidate's fascination with Adolf Hitler. ""He commented more than once that, 'You know, Hitler did some good things, too.'"" In a separate interview with the Atlantic, Kelly described how Trump demoaned that he did not have generals who were loyal in the way he believed military commanders had been to Hitler. His statements have propelled the issue of fascism to the forefront of the US presidential election, with Kamala Harris amplifying Kelly’s comments during a CNN town hall meeting. She said that it was “deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous” that he would “invoke” Hitler, and later told moderator Anderson Cooper that she agreed that Trump was a fascist. Trump hit back at Kelly on his Truth Social platform by calling him a “degenerate” and a “low life”, while also inaccurately accusing Harris on X of calling him Adolf Hitler, when it was Kelly who made the direct reference. His X post accusing Harris of “going so far as to call me Adolf Hitler, and anything else that comes to her warped mind”, because, he claims, polls indicate she is losing, has received more than 28 million views as of writing. Beyoncé is expected at Harris' Houston rally today, while Bruce Springsteen is next scheduled to appear at Harris’ Philadelphia rally on Monday 28 October."

		Russia wants the world divided and in conflict. NATO cannot let this happen","Matas Maldeikis, Lithuanian MP, Deputy Chair of Future Committee, European Affairs Committee member","24/09/2024,17:43 GMT+2",Europe Decoded,"Russia wants to keep NATO solely focused on the developments in Ukraine, making us oblivious to his imperialist plans elsewhere, Matas Maldeikis writes.","Lithuania has been steadfast in its support for Ukraine. It remains in the top three largest donors by GDP of all NATO nations and its people understand more than most the threat Russia represents. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, we have witnessed Russia becoming progressively authoritarian under Vladimir Putin’s leadership. His objectives remain the same as under the former communist bloc: disrupt, expand and influence. These geopolitical games for power are being played beyond Europe, including in the nations of the ""Global South"". Putin hopes that by pressuring these rapidly developing countries, he can create new diplomatic rifts between them and the West. With division comes an opportunity for Putin to split global support against his invasion of Ukraine and build a new network of Russian client states. The fragile nation of Libya is the most prominent example of this and the launchpad for much of Russia’s campaign in sub-Saharan Africa. Since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has struggled to find a democratic footing. Conflict constantly looms between rival governments and strongmen vying to control Libya’s abundant oil and gas resources. Russia has taken advantage of this instability and has increased its engagement with the predominant strongman in the east of the country, General Khalifa Haftar, who leads a large militia known as the Libyan National Army (LNA). To realise this ambition of a Libyan client state under the Haftar clan, Russia has reinforced Haftar’s nefarious activities, including fuel smuggling and currency printing and has commenced discussions to escalate the military partnership through a Russian nuclear submarine base at the port of Tobruk. Not only do these developments pose direct economic threats to European energy assets and supplies, but they also present military threats, as the Mediterranean will be opened to Russian forces. As a nation, Libya is of key strategic import to Putin. He sees its proximity to southern European states like Italy and Spain and knows influence over important energy resources can be used to leverage European energy and foreign policy. Libya remains the starting point for most migration journeys into Europe — something further conflict in the country will only increase. Combined with its wealth of resources, Libya could not be a more attractive platform for Russia to base its operations in Africa, and connect them with supply routes in Syria. Libya has proved to be an ideal funnel for Putin to insert his Russian mercenaries, driving Russian proxy forces into the heart of Africa. Sudan, Mali and other Sahelian states have all felt these repercussions as Russian fighters, bent on mayhem, are let loose alongside militias, juntas and rebel forces. This game plan is already delivering returns in countries such as Niger and Mali, whose upstart military governments have also recently severed ties with Ukraine. To expand this corridor of chaos in Libya, Putin has looked to hold sway over important national institutions. The National Oil Corporation (NOC), under Chairman Ferhat Bengdara, is continuing to succumb to the corruption enabled by the divisions in the country, with billions of dollars of public funds still unaccounted for, helping drive the much relied upon Libyan oil industry into the ground. In the past few weeks, an escalation from Haftar’s forces has brought new uncertainty to European energy security as vast oil fields like El Sharara are blockaded and closed by his LNA, with a slow and limp verbal response from his allies in the NOC. As more of Libya falls under the influence of Haftar, there is a real prospect of it becoming a vassal state for Putin. Russia wants to keep NATO solely focused on the developments in Ukraine, making us oblivious to his imperialist plans elsewhere. NATO must remain united in the face of growing energy security challenges and work collectively in our ambitions to support efforts against these geopolitical games. Only then can we ensure that Russia feels the full force of international sanctions and that our allies in Ukraine are successful.

While many creatives try to sneak in their influences and hope no one notices, the Cork-born, London-based artist is putting them front and centre in his latest project, HomEage. The series features striking ""half-and-half portraits"", fusing his signature aesthetic with that of the legends who have shaped him, from the likes of Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol to Frida Kahlo and Sex Pistols artist Jamie Reid. ""The artwork is split down the middle, with the second half repainted in the style of another artist. It looks like two different versions or personalities of the same character,"" explained DAC from his studio in Mile End, London. He added: ""With this project, there’s no hiding - it's all out there. It’s meant to celebrate those influences and those artists."" Renowned for his larger-than-life outdoor street murals that can be found all over the world, HomEage marks DAC's first solo show since 2021, and is being held in at London’s St Martins Lane crypt gallery on 25 and 26 October. The project is also available in book form from the West Contemporary Editions website. Euronews Culture sat down with DAC before the show's unveiling to discuss everything from his journey to becoming a full-time artist at 40, the impact of AI in the art world, and his creative process for creating gigantic murals. Euronews Culture: How did you become a full-time artist? Fin DAC: My career as an artist started super late, when I was around 40. I had just come out of a fairly stressful relationship, and I essentially wanted something to take my mind off what I was going through at the time. I used to draw as a child, and I have memories of being alone in my room, completely content just doing that. So I thought, okay, if I start to draw and paint, that might give me that kind of meditation or therapy. And it’s true - it silences the world completely. Painting seemed like an easy route to take. Even if I didn’t become a full-time artist, it didn’t matter. I was content in my job as a web designer and developer at the time. But once I really got into painting, it snowballed quickly; I became a full-time artist within 2 or 3 years. Tell us more about your latest project 'HomEage'. It’s essentially about split personalities. The artwork is split down the middle, with the second half repainted in the style of another artist. It looks like two different versions or personalities of the same character. It started as an interim project back in 2020 during the first pandemic lockdown in California. Being away from home and not seeing my family made me think a lot about home. The first four pieces I created focused on artists who inspired me and were my favorites. Once those were done, I found the process so interesting that I kept going over the last few years. The second batch of four focused specifically on New York artists from the 1980s, like Warhol, Basquiat, and Haring - everyone knows their names, even if you’re not into art. I kept adding more and more names to the list. Many artists pretend they’ve come up with everything themselves, but nobody does that anymore. Everybody takes influence from somewhere; it’s just about how well you can hide where those influences come from. With this project, there’s no hiding - it's all out there. It’s meant to celebrate those influences and those artists. I wanted to see if I could incorporate both our styles in some magical way. I’m not sure I succeeded, but I gave myself the opportunity to learn. The show is being presented in an underground crypt. What’s the significance of that? That decision was made by West Contemporary, who are hosting the exhibition. We wanted to find an old venue with a history because this is an art history project at its essence. We aimed to find a location that fed into the concept of history and the idea that this old building is now being reused for something completely different from its original purpose. It’s taking on another character, which is essentially what I’m doing with the artworks - creating another character. What do you hope audiences take from this exhibition? Honestly, I don’t know. We’re really doing the exhibition just so people can view the works. The way I’ve run my career would be considered at odds with how most artists approach theirs. I’m not particularly interested in doing shows or in gallery representation. I don’t care about being shown at Basel or Frieze Art Fair; it’s just not on my list of priorities. If it happens, great, but essentially everything I do is according to how I want to do it, and hopefully, people will follow along for the ride. You’re renowned for your large-scale murals. How has it been focusing on smaller-scale canvases and paper? Honestly, the bigger pieces are easier. When painting a piece for a gallery, I know someone is going to get very close to it, so I have to be much more of a perfectionist compared to a wall mural. Generally, with a wall, people aren’t looking at the details; they’re impressed by the whole thing. They’ll take a photo, post it on Instagram, and that’s enough for them. Once you get over the technical aspect of scaling the image up, which street artists have mastered over the years, I find it easier and much more enjoyable. How would you describe your style and the aesthetics of your work? I call it ""urban aesthetics,"" which is more of a label. This term originates from a group of creatives in the early 20th century who believed that art and design should focus solely on beauty rather than socio-political commentary. When I began painting, most of the surrounding work had a Banksy-esque style - socio-political commentary, political jokes, and so on. I didn’t want my work to be that way. When I learned about the aesthetics movement, their motto resonated with me because I want my art to focus on portraiture and beauty, depicting women as they might have been represented throughout art history. The mask is a recurring theme in your work. What's its significance? I can’t tell you that. Or I’d have to kill you... No, there are only two people in the world who know the true meaning of the mask. The shape of it relates to superhero themes and hidden identities, but the elements of the mask have specific meanings that I don’t reveal. All art should be open to interpretation. If there’s a mystery and you can’t find out the answer, it remains intriguing. Once the answer is revealed, it loses interest and people move on. How do you actually execute these massive murals. Could you walk me through the process, from the idea to the final execution? I like to work in environments where I can adapt the building to the art or vice versa, using architectural elements to inform my design. However, those projects are quite difficult to find. In terms of concepting, I prefer not to plan before arriving at the location because I want the environment and light to influence what I'm creating. In terms of execution, different artists have their methods, but I use a technique called the squiggle method. I learned it from an Australian artist named RONE, who suggested it would really help improve my work. The squiggle method involves painting random lines, smiley faces, letters, and numbers all over the wall, then taking a photograph. I import that image into Photoshop or another app and overlay the image I want to paint, using those chaotic lines as a sort of distorted grid to map out where, in my case, the portrait will go. When working on a 200-foot tall wall, you can't guarantee that your lines will remain parallel or horizontal. By using the squiggle grid, I can reference features like a nose, knowing its relationship to nearby elements. For example, I can pinpoint where the nostril goes because it aligns with a specific mark. If I had a traditional grid, the entire nose might fit within one square, but I wouldn't have anything to connect the nostrils to smaller features. This method is clever and works perfectly every time. What's the largest mural you've done to date? I think the largest was a portrait of Frida Kahlo that I painted in Guadalajara, probably in 2018 or 2019. It's about 200 feet tall. What I love about it is that when you photograph the wall and cut out the background - like the buildings and skyline - it looks like it could be a piece on canvas. What motivates you to create such large-scale outdoor murals? The notion of large scale is secondary. When I started, I was painting small pieces in London; it’s about presenting your work differently than in a gallery. Many people feel uncomfortable in galleries and museums, often thinking they must buy something if they go. When you present art publicly, you’re open to the public's reactions, which can be good or bad. You have to accept that. I enjoy being out in public. I spent a lot of the last four years doing studio work, and while I don’t miss painting, I definitely miss traveling. Painting murals allowed me to travel to New Zealand, Australia, the US, and Japan, places where culturally you're going to find something different, however extreme that difference would be. You're also going to meet people who have different sensibilities to you because every single person who grows up in a country somehow has their personality morphed or molded by the country that they live in. What seems normal in England might not be the same in America. With street art, every artist has the same opportunity to showcase their work. For many it’s just about overcoming the fear of putting their art on the wall and the potential for negative reactions. A post shared by Fin DAC (@findac) What are your thoughts on the emergence of AI in the art world? For me, AI is just a tool. Some people will embrace it, others won't. Some claim it’s the end of the world for art, while others don’t. In the film industry, they said special effects would ruin it, but look at the highest-grossing films since their introduction. I think we have bigger issues to worry about in terms of AI, like warfare and global impacts. I’m neither for nor against AI; and I'm not concerned about its effect on my work. I have a specific brand, and while one might assume it could be easily replicated, I’m not worried. As an artist, if you’re not evolving, you’ll inevitably face copycats, whether they're using AI or not. It’s just the nature of art. What are you most proud of in your career so far? I've said this before - but just being an artist. I didn't start until I was 40 because I convinced myself that I had nothing to say or offer. You know, when you're growing up and you tell people you want to be an artist, the majority will say you need to get a real job. But what could be more real than doing something you love? Not only making money from it but also affecting people positively, hopefully. I had to overcome a lot of mental negativity. I had persuaded myself that I couldn't be an artist. The reason I became one was that I was in such a low place in my life that none of the negative chatter in my head mattered anymore. I wanted to paint just to get some form of calmness in my life. And it worked! HomEage, hosted by West Contemporary Art, is being held in at London’s St Martins Lane crypt gallery on 25 and 26 October."
Will the European Central Bank opt for a large rate cut in December?,Tina Teng,"25/10/2024,6:36 GMT+2",Economy,"Money markets see an increased likelihood of the European Central Bank (ECB) deepening its rate cuts in December following weak economic data. However, analysts expect the bank to maintain a gradual approach to rate reductions due to the persistent upside risks in inflation.","Market participants have raised their expectations for the European Central Bank (ECB) to take a significant step with its next interest rate move, following poor business activity indicators on Thursday. Money markets are now pricing in a 50% chance of the bank cutting the interest rate by half a percentage point in December. Meanwhile, ECB officials are divided on the necessity of such a large reduction. Major European government bond yields fell significantly after the weak October business activity readings in the manufacturing and services sectors on Thursday. Movements in bond yields typically reflect expectations of the ECB’s interest rate trajectory, particularly for short-term instruments. The yield on the 2-year German and French government bond, which is highly sensitive to interest rate changes, fell to yearly lows before rebounding, indicating that traders have increased their bets on a larger rate cut from the central bank. According to S&P Global’s flash estimates, the manufacturing Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) for both France and Germany has been contracting for more than two years in October, though Germany’s reading has improved. France’s services PMI is expected to slip back into contraction after two months of growth, suggesting that the boost from the Paris Olympics was temporary. This data, along with a sharp decline in headline inflation in September, has significantly raised the chances of the ECB delivering a steeper rate cut in December, following consecutive cuts in September and October—the first such moves in 13 years. The eurozone’s annual inflation fell to 1.8% in September, its lowest level in three years and below the ECB’s 2% target. However, core CPI, which excludes volatile items like food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco, remained relatively high at 2.7%. As such, the upcoming consumer price index for October, due next week, will be crucial for market sentiment. Michael McCarthy, market strategist and chief commercial officer at Moomoo Australia, said that eurozone inflation still presents “substantial upside risk.” He added: “Despite expectations, next week's core inflation reading for October is likely to show an increase in the year-on-year rate to 2.8% (from 2.7% previously),” and “If the increase exceeds consensus, there could be a sharp adjustment in interest rate markets.” ECB officials are divided over whether to implement a quarter-percentage-point or half-percentage-point cut, but all have expressed confidence that inflation will return to target. ECB President Christine Lagarde said in an interview with Bloomberg TV: “The pace will be determined based on backward- and forward-looking elements, using our three criteria and applying judgment.” Some Governing Council members, such as Mario Centeno from Portugal and François Villeroy de Galhau from France, argue that economic risks outweigh inflation risks. Meanwhile, others, including Klaas Knot from the Netherlands and Pierre Wunsch from Belgium, hold a more hawkish view, arguing that a 50 basis point cut is premature unless there is a further deterioration in the economic outlook. Slightly more officials favour a gradual approach rather than an accelerated step. In addition to inflation data, key eurozone economies will release their third-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures next week, which will provide further insight into the region’s economic trajectory. The IMF has downgraded the euro area’s economic outlook to just 0.8% in 2024 and 1.2% in 2025, a 0.1% and 0.3% reduction from its July forecast. Dilin Wu, a research strategist at Pepperstone, wrote in an email to Euronews: “I believe the chances of the ECB cutting rates by 50 basis points in December are quite slim, especially after the back-to-back rate cuts.” However, she acknowledged the challenging economic conditions in the region: “A 50 basis point cut would represent a significant shift and could potentially trigger greater market turmoil.”"
Isabelle Huppert awarded the Prix Lumière & 10 key takeaways from her masterclass,David Mouriquand,"19/10/2024,11:29 GMT+221/10/2024,15:56 GMT+2",Cinema,"Isabelle Huppert was awarded the coveted Prix Lumière. Euronews Culture attended the ceremony, as well as her masterclass. Here are the 10 things we learned.","To mark the 15th anniversary of the Lumière Film Festival, Isabelle Huppert was awarded the prestigious Prix Lumière at the traditional award ceremony, held last night at the Amphithéâtre 3000 in Lyon. With an audience including the likes of Alfonso Cuarón, Claire Denis, Noémie Merlant, Anthony Delon, James Franco, Emmanuelle Béart and Julien Clerc (who took to the stage to play his famous song ‘Ma Préférence’ in honour of the evening’s main star), Huppert came on stage to receive her prize. She joins an illustrious list of past recipients, including Martin Scorsese, Jane Fonda, Quentin Tarantino, Jane Campion, Pedro Almodóvar and Wong Kar-wai. “I was told that the Lumière prize was special, but it's much more than I could have imagined, and yet I have a lot of imagination,” she shared, visibly moved and referencing the honour of being awarded a prize so intimately linked to the history of cinema. Speaking about looking back at the past and looking to the future, she finally emphasised the importance of the present, “this joyous and wonderful moment full of emotion.” Check out this video for clips of the evening, as well as reactions from some of the celebrities present at the award ceremony last night, whom Euronews Culture got to interview. Prior to the awards ceremony, Huppert participated in a masterclass, a rare exercise for the actress, who isn’t a huge fan of discussing her work and career in public. The on-stage conversation was with Lumière Film Festival boss and Cannes chief Thierry Frémaux, with the likes of Claire Denis and François Ozon, who both directed Huppert in White Material and 8 Women, as well as Coralie Fargeat (The Substance) and Anthony Delon sitting in the audience. She spoke openly and candidly about her career. Here are the 10 things we learned at the masterclass: Cinephile? Huppert revealed that prior to starting her acting career, she had seen few movies. “It’s still the case to this day. We didn’t go to the cinema that much back in the day. I’d need to come back to Lyon and the festival more often,” she quipped. Film choices Huppert has worked with some of the most renowned and international directors, from Bertrand Tavernier, Claire Denis, Werner Schroeter, Michael Haneke, Joachim Trier, to Hong Sang-soo, Paul Verhoeven, Wes Anderson and Ira Sachs - to name but a few. “I don’t know if I know how to read scripts, but maybe I can recognise filmmakers and that matters obviously in the choices we make,” she said. “The choices are difficult, mysterious even. It’s a mix of many things. It’s pure intuition, ultimately.” She also revealed that when reading scripts, she would make her mind up based on a line that would stick with her. For example, in La Pianiste (The Piano Teacher), Michael Haneke’s 2001 erotic psychological drama, she honed in on the line: “La froideur, ça vous dit quelque chose?” (“What does coldness speak to you?”). Speaking of which... Restraint at all costs Huppert is not known as the ‘warmest’ on-screen presence, with many of her roles characterised as chilly, standoffish or even emotionally distant. However, this is by design. Referencing that quote from The Piano Teacher, she stated that it “sums up everything it means to be an actor.” “It may seem surprising, but when people think of acting, you may think of feelings, therefore of sentimentality, of something more rounded. But when you’re acting, you’re in a certain coldness,” she said. “When (her character in The Piano Teacher, Erika) sees the young man play, she understands that his way of playing will probably be his way of loving, something that doesn’t do justice to the beauty of the music and therefore of the feeling. I believe it’s the same when you’re acting - you need to be detached from what you’re playing to be a better actor.” “I like to approach every character I play with a distance, which often allows one to place humour into moments and roles where it is least expected. The Pianist is not really a comedy, to say the least, but there are some funny aspects to it...” Speaking of Haneke... Near misses Huppert almost never worked with the celebrated Austrian filmmaker. “We kept missing each other,” she said. “He had first asked me to play in ‘Funny Games’ and I had decided to not do it. The film is extraordinary, but I found that it didn’t leave any room for the imaginary actress that I was. To me, the film was like a scientific and clinical demonstration of how violence operates on the spectator and how the spectator is the plaything of this staging.” After Funny Games, Haneke proposed two other films that she wasn’t able to do. By the time he suggested The Piano Teacher, an ultimatum was given. “He told me, if you don’t want to do it, it’s over, I won’t propose you another film,” shared Huppert. “For that reason, I said ‘Yes, of course, I’ll do it! And then, I really read the script while I was in the plane! The next minute, I was landing at the Vienna airport (for the shoot).” Huppert would then go on to star for Haneke in Le Temps du Loup (2003), Amour (2012) and Happy End (2017). A happy end, indeed. “Do you think you can coax Haneke out of retirement?” asked Fremaux. “Not sure,” she replied. The perfect soldier on set? When asked whether she did what she was told on set, Huppert rather diplomatically, but with a twinkle in her eye, answered: “Yes, if the film goes according to plan.” “When you say ‘yes’ to a project, several stories start. I was lucky to meet directors who let me tell stories between me and myself.” When asked whether there’d been any conflicts on set, Huppert shared that she didn’t have any on a personal level, but that she had witnessed some – mentioning French film director Maurice Pialat. “Conflict can be a way of dialoguing and it can be interesting too. Making a film is hard, and making a dream concrete is not easy. Conflict is just a part of life.” She later added: “The whole history of cinema, painting, and literature is made of that – that’s why you make films, it’s both a big mystery and a blessing… There are people who like it and people who don’t. I don’t think we make movies to please everyone. And all the better. The hegemonic fantasy isn’t good – we all see where that can lead...” Self-deprecation and confessions Throughout the masterclass, Huppert was very candid and self-deprecating about the projects she’d starred in, many of which “I’m sure no one has seen!” One of the films she mentioned was her role in Otto Preminger’s 1975 thriller Rosebud. The film was originally set to star Robert Mitchum, who left the project due to disagreements with Preminger. Actually, it was due to Mitchum’s heavy drinking and the fact that Mitchum shared with Huppert: “I couldn’t give a fuck about cinema anymore.” This saddened Huppert, who shared the anecdote that Mitchum had played her an artist he’d been listening to at the time: Kris Kristofferson, who died earlier this year. Huppert would then go on to star alongside Kristofferson in Michael Cimino’s epic western Heaven’s Gate, which was infamously panned and gained further infamy as a film that not only generated financial damage for the studios due to its budget costs, but had a wider effect on the American film industry as a cautionary tale for studios to shift away from director-driven films. “At least I got to tell Kris Kristofferson that he was Robert Mitchum’s favourite singer on the set of 'Heaven’s Gate'!” On misogyny “Misogyny doesn’t just exist in cinema – it’s everywhere. I’ve learned to see it and recognise it. It has never gotten in the way of my acting.” Stairs not lifts Speaking about her career, Huppert said that she isn’t afraid of taking on roles that demand her to be away from home or get out of her comfort zone. When asked whether she was ever abroad on a shoot and in her hotel room at the end of the day, asking herself ‘What am I doing here?’, she retorted: “I love being in hotels – it really isn’t the worst part of my profession! As long as I can access my room via stairs and not the lift.” Indeed, Huppert confirmed that she has a phobia of lifts. “I’m scared of lifts, but not the unknown.” On her favourite books Huppert stated that she’s not a fan of revealing too much about her personal life, and that includes her favourite books or the ones that have shaped her. “Tell me what you read, I'll tell you who you are... Where’s the fun in that?” She did however reveal... Did you know? An audience member randomly asked Huppert what her favourite flowers were. “Roses.” Now you know. The Lumière Film Festival ends on 20 October."

                                            & Fred Ponsard","16/10/2024,11:35 GMT+218/10/2024,16:56 GMT+2",Cinema,"Euronews Culture sits down with Vanessa Paradis, whose film career is celebrated at this year's Lumière Film Festival.","Alongside Isabelle Huppert and Benicio del Toro, the iconic Vanessa Paradis is one of the Lumiere Film Festival’s guests of honour for this 16th edition. The 51-year-old multidisciplinary artist has done it all. From shooting to international fame at the age of 14 with her single ‘Joe Le Taxi’, sustaining a successful musical career with critically acclaimed albums like 1988’s ‘M et J’, 2000’s ‘Bliss’ and the stunning ‘Divinidylle’ in 2007, to modelling and a filmography that has seen her collaborating with some of the greatest modern filmmakers like Jean-Claude Brisseau (Noce Blanche), Patrice Leconte (Une Chance Sur Deux, La Fille Sur Le Pont), Jean-Marc Vallée (Café de Flore), and Yann Gonzalez (Knife + Heart), there isn’t much the French star hasn’t done. Of course, she became known for a while in the world press as the wife of Johnny Depp, but her career trumps any tabloid gossip. She’s won countless prizes for her contributions to music and cinema, and the Lumière Film Festival is celebrating the latter with the screening this year of three of her most beloved films: the aforementioned La Fille Sur Le Pont (The Girl on the Bridge) and Café de Flore, as well as the hit romcom L’Arnacoeur (Heartbreaker) by Pascal Chaumeil. Euronews Culture sat down with Vanessa Paradis to chat about the festival, her desire to one day star in a musical, her fears regarding artificial intelligence, and what the next few years have in store for one of France’s most beloved performers. Euronews Culture: You're one of the guests of honour at this year’s edition of the Lumière Film Festival – how does it feel to have your on-screen career celebrated in the birthplace of cinema? Vanessa Paradis: It’s obviously very flattering and moving. Before I came to the festival, I knew there was going to be a masterclass I’d have to attend, and I was wondering whether I was going to have anything interesting to say! But it's a wonderful festival that celebrates cinema and the heritage of cinema. There are so many people - sublime cinephiles! I mean, I can be a cinephile, but I'm often missing references and half the information, and so it can be less exciting to talk about cinema. In this case, we happened to be talking about the films I've made and shot. And I didn't know that there was going to be a five-minute montage with lots of extracts from films I've been in. It made me dizzy, and very emotional. I was afraid I was going to answer questions with tears in my eyes... It was a lot! It’s true that it’s a festival that provokes a lot of emotions... Yes, because guests come to talk about their films and the films of others, but there's no competition at the Lumière Festival. There’s nothing at stake, so everyone's much more relaxed. It’s so rare in fact... How can I put it? In our lives, in our jobs, it's always one thing for another. We use each other. But here, it’s a celebration and more of a gift. It's something free. That’s an ugly way to describe it, but do you see what I mean? It's something natural. And then to go and see films - old films you wouldn’t get to see on the big screen... I think of parents who come with their children to see these films and that for me is very, very moving. It’s both intimate and quite grandiose... That’s exactly it. We had the opportunity to ask you prior to the opening ceremony what your “Rosebud film” was – the film that makes you love cinema and which you go back to the most. You told us that it was Singin’ In The Rain – which seems perfect for you, as both a singer and an actress. Which leads me to the question – when are we getting a musical? It's my dream to star in one! I've been offered musicals, but they're not completely musicals - they are musical from time to time. I did get the chance to be in the Poiraud brothers’ film Atomik Circus, in which I got to sing a few songs and dance a few numbers... But it wasn’t fully a musical. The musical I dream of starring in is the kind for which I have to train for a whole year – to learn how to dance numbers I don’t know, to sing incredible songs while telling a sumptuous story. That’s my dream! I can kick myself for not getting there after all these years of working. Maybe I haven’t provoked it enough or looked for it hard enough. But it’s never too late! I ended up rewatching your 1998 film Une Chance Sur Deux the other day, in which you star opposite two titans of French cinema, who are sadly no longer with us: Jean-Paul Belmondo and Alain Delon, who died a few months ago... I'm incredibly lucky to have been the one who was on that set, between Delon and Belmondo, and to have been filmed by Patrice Leconte. Who wouldn’t want to act with these two, who were reuniting on screen after all these years? And I got to be the young woman for whom these two potential fathers are fighting for. I can say that I was lucky enough to shoot with these two, and also to shoot with Jeanne Moreau, with Depardieu, Bruno Crémer, Daniel Auteuil... I’m forgetting to mention many others, but it’s crazy how lucky I’ve been and how emotional it makes me. Your taste for comedy stands out in your filmography, as well as a kind of anti-conformism in your choice of roles. It's a desire for adventure. A desire to experience things that you don't get to in real life. To play strong roles, to play colourful roles and to express yourself.  That's what's so exciting about playing strong, playing crazy, playing poetic. I’ve had the pleasure of working with people who have had a lot of humour and a lot of poetry. And, of course, a lot of love too. So, when I'm playing a difficult or gentle role, there's always that in my heart – because at the end of the day, we're all people who want to be loved and to love. To come back to the Lumière Festival, it feels like the ideal festival for cinephiles, with its restorations of older films, some of which you can see on screen for the first time in decades. This seems to clash with the rampant use of AI in both cinema and music, as artificial intelligence seems to be in contradiction to what this festival represents in terms of cultural heritage. What do you make of these technological advances? Are you intrigued or scared that it could represent the beginning of the end for creatives like yourself? Yes, it scares me. After that, however, I don't know. I don't know enough about artificial intelligence to know exactly what it can and can’t do, but I do know that for medicine, for example, it's something extraordinary and that it can save lives. In this case, I think it's fabulous. On the other hand, in art, I find the use of AI totally horrible. What's more, there are a lot of people who hijack our images, our lyrics, our songs, who fool the public...  I find this ugly. And it shows once again that human beings always go a bit too far with things that have the potential to be good. There’s always a moment when we go too far. As a species, we’re not particularly subtle... True. But I don't believe that AI can kill the creative profession. I mean, I don't want to believe it. Already, artificial intelligence can’t endanger live shows. We'll always have that. As for cinema... Well, look at this year’s Prix Lumière winner - Isabelle Huppert. Let’s see AI try to create a fake Isabelle Huppert! AI will never be able to do on screen what she is able to make us feel with her acting, with her powerful emotions. I can’t believe that an artificial intelligence could match her. You’re a shape-shifting and versatile artist. What does the future hold for you? Whether it’s music, cinema, and also theatre, after your Molière nomination with the play 'Maman'... What do the next few years look like? I can see the next few years going quite well, because I'm actually going to start shooting a film next week. It's Jérôme Commandeur's next film, with François Damiens and Laurent Lafitte. I can't wait to get started. And then I'm also in the process of preparing my new album, so when it's done, I'll have to release it and tour it... So the next few years are going to be pretty busy! And I almost forgot, there's also the Anne Le Ny film which I shot last year (Histoire d’un mariage) and will be released this coming February. So as you can see, very busy!

Tech billionaires are on track to become the world's first trillionaires. Who will get there first?,Imane El Atillah,"13/10/2024,14:41 GMT+216/10/2024,14:46 GMT+2",Tech News,"The tech industry is home to eight of the world’s ten wealthiest individuals, but who among them will be the first to reach trillionaire status?","Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, one of the richest people in the world, has recently joined the exclusive group of those whose wealth has reached or exceeded $200 billion (€182.57 billion). Therefore, he becomes the newest member of this elite club, which includes only two other tech leaders - Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Zuckerberg's wealth accumulation is largely attributed to his position as the largest shareholder of Meta, the parent company of social media networks Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, as well as the messaging platform WhatsApp. According to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, the three richest individuals in the world all come from the technology industry. Indeed, out of the top 10 wealthiest people, eight are from this sector. These include some notable names such as Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle, followed respectively by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Larry Page, co-founder of Alphabet, Google’s holding company. The tech industry has also been one of the best-performing sectors, with six out of the seven companies to have reached trillion-dollar status coming from this field. According to a recent report by Informa Connect Academy, Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta are all valued at over $1 trillion (€918 billion) as of July 2024. The same report also explored which of today’s multi-billionaires were most likely to reach trillionaire status, with predictions that the world could see its first trillionaire in as few as three years. The analysis was based on the net worth data of the 30 wealthiest people in the world, and calculations of their average annual growth rate over the last five years. The results were then used to create 30-year forecasts for each person's wealth to predict who is likely to become a trillionaire and estimate the year they would reach that status. Leading the list was Musk who could become the first trillionaire by 2027, with a net worth value ""growing at an average rate of 109.88 per cent every year"". The majority of Musk’s fortune is tied to his stakes in Tesla, the world's most valuable car manufacturer, and private rocket company SpaceX. He also owns about 79 per cent of X Corp, which he acquired in 2022 for $44 billion (about €39.6 billion), though its value has significantly fallen since then. Moreover, Musk also owns stakes in several startups including Neuralink, The Boring Company, and xAI. He could be followed by Gautam Adani, founder of the Adani Group, based in India, who is expected to reach the trillionaire status by 2028. That same year, Jensen Huang, one of the founders of the trillion-dollar company NVIDIA, is anticipated to become the next tech-industry trillionaire, with an annual growth rate in net worth of nearly 112 per cent. Out of all the 28 individuals predicted to become trillionaires within the next 30 years, 11 (about 40 per cent) were from the technology field alone. The list included other major names in the industry such as Zuckerberg and Bezos as well as Larry Page, Zhang Yiming, the founder of TikTok's parent company ByteDance, and Bill Gates, rounding out the list."

Weekly recap: Uncertainty moves markets into retreat from all-time highs,Tina Teng,"25/10/2024,9:16 GMT+211:07",Markets,Global markets are set to finish the week lower due to uncertainties surrounding the economic and political landscape ahead of the US presidential election and the Japanese general election. Risk-off sentiment shaped market trends as precious metal prices surged.,"Both European and US markets retreated from all-time highs and are likely to end the week lower as the rally lost momentum. Risk aversion seems to be driving the selloffs amid economic concerns and the upcoming US presidential election. Safe-haven assets such as the US dollar, gold, and silver climbed further, while the euro and other currencies, as well as crude oil and copper prices, declined due to soured sentiment. US government bond yields rose to a three-month high as markets expect the Federal Reserve to slow the pace of rate cuts for the rest of the year. European benchmarks are all in the red for the week, with the Euro Stoxx 600 falling by 0.86%, Germany’s DAX down by 1.09%, France’s CAC 40 losing 1.44%, and the British FTSE 100 declining by 1.06% over the past five trading days. At the sector level, most sectors experienced negative weekly performance due to downbeat sentiment, with mining and energy stocks being the biggest laggards. Major miners and oil producers, such as Rio Tinto, BHP, BP, and Shell, continued to decline amid falling industrial metal and crude oil prices. The IMF downgraded the eurozone’s economic outlook, citing particular weakness in manufacturing activity in Germany and Italy. Among large-cap stocks, performances were mixed. Novo Nordisk fell 2.4%, while LVMH and ASML rebounded nearly 4% over the week, recovering from recent drops. However, both stocks are still down by 15% and 3% year-to-date due to disappointing quarterly results. China's economic slowdown remains a primary challenge for these major European companies. On the earnings front, SAP reported strong quarterly earnings, driving its shares to an all-time high. The German tech giant's cloud revenue rose by 25%, with its artificial intelligence-backed business accelerated in growth due to restructuring efforts and a strategic shift. In the UK, Barclays unveiled solid quarterly results, with its investment bank's revenue increasing by 6% year-on-year. Its shares soared to a nine-month high in pre-market hours, with the positive outcome attributed to a strategic overhaul focused on cost-cutting, announced earlier this year. The euro weakened further against the US dollar over the week despite a rebound on Thursday. The weakness in the euro is due to rising US government bond yields, contrasting with declining yields in major European counterparts. Economic data has also increased the likelihood of the ECB accelerating its rate cuts. According to Eurostat, eurozone manufacturing activity remained in contraction in October, especially in France. Despite a slight improvement in Germany, the figures remained weak, suggesting ongoing challenges for economic growth in the region. US stock markets also ended the week on a negative note as rising government bond yields pressured equity valuations. The bond selloff echoed trends from 1995, with traders expecting a soft landing for the US economy following better-than-expected October data. However, S&P Global estimates indicate that US manufacturing activity may remain in contraction for the fourth consecutive month in October. Over the past five trading days, the Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased by 2.08%, the S&P 500 declined by 0.93%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4%. Within the S&P 500, eight out of eleven sectors posted weekly declines, with industrial and materials leading losses, down by 2.15% and 2.73%, respectively. Utilities, real estate, and consumer discretionary were the only sectors to post slight gains. Tesla reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, sending its shares soaring 22% on Thursday and erasing most of its October losses. The company’s automotive revenue returned to growth after declining for the past two quarters, and the Cybertruck achieved profitability for the first time since its deliveries began late last year. Stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region were mostly lower for the week, reflecting global trends. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell more than 3% ahead of the country’s general election this weekend. The Bank of Japan's rate decision will be closely watched next week. Australia's ASX 200 also dropped by less than 1%, largely due to the underperformance of the mining sector. However, Chinese markets stabilised as investors reassessed the impact of the government’s stimulus measures"

"First North Korean troops reach Russian combat zone, Kyiv reports",Euronews,"24/10/2024,22:05 GMT+222:16",Europe News,The EU has condemned this move as a violation of international law.,"The first North Korean military units trained in eastern Russia have arrived in the combat zone, Kyiv reported on Thursday. North Korean soldiers were already spotted in Russia's border region of Kursk on Wednesday, The Ukrainian Defence Ministry's Main Directorate of Intelligence said. According to Ukrainian authorities, Pyongyang troops arriving in Russia are being trained at five military training grounds located in the country's east. The soldiers whom Russia intends to use in the war against Ukraine are given several weeks of training before their deployment. The number of North Korean troops stationed in Russia currently totals around 12,000, including 500 officers as well as three generals, according to Ukrainian intelligence information. Russian Deputy Defence Minister Yunus-Bek Yevkurov has reportedly been assigned the task of overseeing the training of North Korean troops. Pyongyang is supplying the soldiers with ammunition, bedding, winter clothing and footwear, and hygiene products. Moscow is also providing each North Korean soldier with standard rations of 50 metres of toilet paper and 300 grams of soap each month, authorities claim. Ukrainian intelligence believes that the Kremlin has high hopes for North Korean reinforcements in its war against Ukraine. The authorities in Kyiv, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have repeatedly warned that Pyongyang is sending its troops to get involved in the fighting. South Korea and the US have also previously warned of the impending deployment of North Korean troops to the Ukrainian front. Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a press conference following the BRICS summit in Kazan, commented for the first time on reports about the presence of soldiers from North Korea in Russian territory for deployment in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. An NBC News correspondent at the conference asked the Russian leader about the military's goals, citing satellite images purporting to show Pyongyang soldiers in Russia. ""Imagery is a serious thing. If there are images, it means they reflect something,"" Putin said. The Russian president also noted that the State Duma ratified a strategic partnership treaty with North Korea on Thursday. The treaty includes an article on mutual military assistance. ""We have never doubted that the North Korean leadership takes our agreements seriously,"" Putin said, ""but what and how we will do is already our business within the framework of this article."" ""The European Union is deeply alarmed by reports that North Korea is sending troops to participate in Russia's illegal war of aggression against Ukraine,"" the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said in a statement. ""This would be a serious violation of international law, including the most fundamental principles of the UN Charter,"" Borrell said, warning of ""serious consequences for European and global peace and security"". The EU strongly condemns the deepening military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow and arms transfers, which flagrantly violate numerous UN Security Council resolutions, he added. The EU ""will coordinate its actions with international partners on this issue, including retaliatory measures,"" Borrell concluded."

Not adding up? Why children's financial education should start early,Indrabati Lahiri,"26/10/2024,7:20 GMT+2",Economy,"Euronews Business looks at why children's financial education should begin early on in primary school, what financial lessons would benefit them the most, and how schools and governments can help implement this.","We live in a costly world and it's important that children learn how to manage it from an early age. Primary school is a good place to start. Starting early can help prepare children to learn healthy ways to manage their finances. Through the process, children can learn about everything within the financial world, including debt, mortgages, pensions and budgets. According to the Money and Pensions Service (MaPS), an arm's-length body of the UK Government: ""Financial education is any activity that helps children develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes they need to manage money well, make informed financial decisions and achieve their goals. ""It can cover a wide range of topics, responding to the needs of children, from recognising notes and coins, basic budget management and saving, to understanding the difference between needs and wants, the link between money and work and keeping money safe."" In recent years, it has become clearer that at least a basic level of financial education needs to be included in school syllabuses, preferably as early as possible. Herminone McKee, chief financial officer (CFO) at SumUp, told Euronews: ""As we look ahead to the next generation of young business leaders and entrepreneurs entering the workforce, it becomes increasingly evident that instilling financial literacy at a young age is a key component to success. ""Despite the digital fluency that characterises 'Gen Z', studies indicate a concerning lack of financial literacy. Schools and parents alike should take care to take advantage of this new tech savvy generation to find innovative teaching methods and new means of technology that resonate with them. ""Because financial literacy is not just about understanding interest rates or how to manage your taxes, it is the foundation for which solid business decisions are made. Something as simple as teaching the value of pocket money in primary schools for example, could be a prerequisite for making sound future investments or putting down a deposit for a house or a flat."" Michael König, academic director of the Strategic Management for Executives Program at Vienna’s WU Executive Academy, told Euronews: ""It should be as natural as swimming that children, from an early age onwards, get acquainted with some foundations of personal finance. Ideally, in primary school. ""What are interest rates? What does inflation mean? What is the time value of money? How does one turn money into wealth, and what are the risks attached to this?"" Professor Carmela Aprea, director of the Mannheim Institute for Financial Education (MIFE), said: ""Financial education could start in primary schools, but in a playful and low-pressure way. For example, children can reflect on their wishes, why something is important to them, and how they could achieve it. They can also look at what their parents do for a living and how and why they spent their money on different things. ""However, I think the most important thing that primary schools can do is equip children with basic skills in numeracy and literacy. These are the most important prerequisites for further learning and everything else in later life, including financial literacy. It should also be kept in mind that parents are the most important socialisation agents in childhood, and that important lessons regarding financial behaviour are learned by them."" Erica Sandberg, consumer finance expert at BadCredit.org, said: ""It is never too young to start teaching children about money! In the primary school years, you would start by just talking about the price of things they like, such as art supplies or swimming lessons, and what a sale is. ""Drop it into normal conversation. It's also a great time to explain to children why people go to work, which is to make sure they and their families are safe and secure."" Lucy Wayman, the maths consultant and school communications lead for 21C, a British company that has developed an AI-driven platform for students to learn maths and help teachers teach it, said children are beginning to form attitudes towards money from a very young age, even when in primary school. ""At 21C we understand that these perceptions will develop into a lifelong view of finances that will affect every aspect of their daily lives. ""It is crucial that, in this fast-evolving digital world, we equip children to develop sound financial awareness. Digital financial crime is rife, and growing. As a provider of digital technology, we also have a moral imperative to play our part in building children’s resilience towards financial risks. ""Having a robust understanding of mathematics is crucial to financial literacy. Being confident at estimating, calculating and comparing, mentally and at speed, reduces vulnerability to being scammed, and it develops a sound basis for interacting confidently in areas of finance. ""Without this, they leave themselves vulnerable to deception, and unable to make informed decisions about their own finances. By weaving realistic scenarios into school maths teaching, 21C ensures that children will not only learn subject matter to pass exams, but develop the practical skills needed for financial decision-making,"" she said. Although teaching kids some financial knowledge in primary school is important, it's also essential to keep these lessons age-appropriate, to ensure that children engage with the concepts as much as possible. Aaron Cirksena, founder and CEO of MDRN Capital, said: ""Kids need to know the basics. They should learn what money is and where it comes from, pretty much like the ABCs of finance. We can introduce simple budgeting concepts so they understand how to divide their allowance into needs, wants, and savings. ""Saving is an essential concept, even setting aside a small amount from their allowance can help. It's all about giving them the tools to navigate their financial future."" Sandberg said: ""Instilling a positive attitude toward money is extremely important at this age. Never be judgmental or in any way ominous. You really want children to believe they will have control over their financial decisions, from earning money to saving and spending it."" Erika Kullberg, founder of personal finance website Erika.com, said: ""It's so important to make sure your kids have a very strong understanding of how credit works before they enter the real world. At 18, they can qualify for a credit card, but it likely will have a very high interest rate and they can get into a lot of financial trouble if they aren’t crystal clear on how to use credit responsibly."" Joe DiSanto, founder and chief executive officer (CEO) at personal finance website Play Louder, believes in a more hands-on approach with his son, instead of leaving it entirely to the school to install healthy financial habits. He said: ""I'm teaching my son, who is in primary school, more about understanding the connection between hard work and earning rewards. He has to do certain chores as a member of the family, but we also offer him the opportunity to earn some money by doing extra chores - ones that he might find particularly unpleasant or less fun. He doesn't get an allowance for his regular chores, but he can make money that he can spend as he chooses by opting to do the extra chores. ""Beyond that, I talk to him about making good or bad choices when spending money and explain that there's an alternative to just earning and spending money. The alternative is investing, where money can turn into more money. ""I've introduced the stock market and investing to him in a simple way, and I've given him the option to invest his money if he wants. This has shown him that he doesn’t have to spend all of his money - he can invest it and potentially grow it. ""In middle school, though, I could see introducing concepts like how to manage earned money, deciding what's worth spending on, the difference between discretionary and required spending, and getting them attuned to these ideas. ""After middle school, in high school, we could start discussing investing more seriously and teaching that it's not just about working for money - we want to put our money to work for us, be entrepreneurial, and not just trade time for money."" König said: ""The perception of risk is really important. In a playful way, children should learn to understand what it means to spend, save or invest their pocket money. In our schools' curricula, we still shy away from such 'financial matters'. This, however, increases the vulnerability of the next generation: Without understanding basic finance, people easily fall prey to Ponzi schemes."" Incentives to save for both parents and children, such as easier access to children's savings accounts, are also important. Other ways schools and governments can help is by adapting financial education to the current generation, through platforms, apps and gamification, such as 21C's Pocket Maths. McKee said: ""There are now so many apps on the market that support financial education for a range of ages, from those that are already used in schools from primary to secondary, to those that can be encouraged for use at home to gamify savings or budgeting, or even planning pocket money.” Cirksena said: ""They can start by incorporating financial literacy into subjects like math, social studies, or life skills classes. It's also important to train teachers so they feel comfortable and equipped to teach these concepts. Maybe partnering with banks and financial organizations can provide resources and fun workshops. “They might also use interactive tools/apps to make learning about money feel like a fun game. If governments can make financial literacy a mandatory part of the curriculum, children can easily learns these essential skills much earlier in life.” Professor Aprea added: ""Schools and governments should invest in good materials and, above all, in good teacher education. And they should include parents in their financial education strategies, as they are so important for child development. Sometimes it also works the other way round. ""When children reflect on finances at school, for example, they also talk about it at the family dinner table and then parents suddenly become more interested in the topic. In any case, it is important to have a broader, systemic perspective not only on children but also on their whole living environment."" Kullberg noted: ""Most of us didn't learn anything about how to create a budget, how credit cards and loans work, or how taxes work. If schools start teaching students these lessons before they enter the adult world, they are giving them a major leg up. Don't be afraid to contact local politicians to advocate for financial education in your local schools."" Although financial education has definitely been included a lot more in school curriculums in the last few years, there are still a number of implementation challenges to overcome before widespread adoption is likely. Aprea said: ""One challenge is that it is time-consuming and costly to develop good financial education materials and to invest in teacher education. Secondly, financial education competes with many other subjects and skills that are equally important, such as health education or sustainability education. ""Here it is important that we find creative ways to connect those issues, because they have one thing in common: Ultimately, they all revolve around the question of what constitutes a good life and by what means this can be achieved. ""Another challenge is to address all relevant parts of the population, as some groups are not so easy to reach. And, finally, money is not a topic to talk about in many countries and it is often associated with shame, especially when people do not have much money. This is also a major challenge for implementation."" Meanwhile, Cirksena noted: ""One big challenge is the lack of a standardised curriculum; if schools are teaching financial literacy differently, there might be a disconnect. Teacher preparedness is also a concern - if they're not comfortable teaching these concepts, it can lead to gaps in what kids learn. ""In regard to socioeconomics, kids from lower-income families might have different experiences with money, making it harder to create lessons that resonate.Parents also play a role if they aren’t reinforcing these lessons at home."" Sandberg added, meanwhile, that on a macro level, change is slow. ""As a teacher, I wouldn't wait for personal finance to be mandated. If you have discretion about which books you read to children during story time, elect those that address money in a fun way."""
French lawmakers vote in favour of new tax on wealth of billionaires,Eleanor Butler,"25/10/2024,17:17 GMT+217:58",Economy,"A majority of lawmakers supported the proposition from the far-left LFI party, despite warnings from the incumbent government.","French lawmakers on Friday voted in favour of a new levy that would tax assets above the €1 billion threshold at 2%. It would apply to anyone who is a tax resident in France or who has assets in France. The amendment, proposed by the far-left LFI party (France Unbowed), comes as France’s National Assembly debates next year’s state budget. A draft proposal created by the incumbent government is debated and amended, before being sent to France’s Senate for another review. The acceptance of the wealth tax comes despite opposition from the ruling Renaissance party, as well as from the National Rally party. Speaking in the National Assembly on Friday, LFI lawmaker Aurelien Le Coq argued: ""In this budget, we are asking for efforts from almost everyone on almost everything, but there is one thing that we aren’t touching.” He added: “There is not a single measure in this budget that decides to tap into the wealth of the richest people.” Le Coq suggested that when simply considering the 10 biggest fortunes in France, the tax would bring in no less than €13bn for the state. Laurent Saint-Martin, Minister Delegate for the Budget and Public Accounts in the incumbent government, criticised the amendment, arguing that it is “the best way to scare off those who can invest in our country”. Friday’s vote comes despite failed efforts in France to reimplement the ISF, a wealth tax in France that was replaced with another levy - the IFI - in 2018. The IFI only relates to real estate assets, meaning that it is not as far-reaching. The newly proposed wealth tax also comes at a time when the French state is greatly in need of extra revenue. France's public deficit hit 5.5% of the country’s GDP last year, massively exceeding forecasts and violating the EU's target of 3%. At the end of last month, new budget minister Laurent Saint-Martin revealed that this year's figure could overshoot 6%. Experts believe that despite Friday’s vote, the suggested wealth tax is unlikely to survive scrutiny from the Senate."
Inside IBM’s first European quantum data centre | Euronews Tech Talks,Alice Carnevali,"09/10/2024,14:56 GMT+215:46",Euronews Tech Talks,"IBM has opened its first European quantum data centre in Ehningen, in the south of Germany. What is it? And how will it impact the lives of European citizens? Euronews Tech Talks travelled to Germany to discover it.","Ehningen, in southern Germany, looks like any other small European town. Located less than 30 km from Stuttgart, it has a library, a church, and a couple of restaurants, and its streets are filled with children playing football. No one would expect that a few kilometres from the residential area lies an industrial hub, home to one of the most groundbreaking technological revolutions: the first International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) quantum computing data centre in Europe. On October 1st, the US company officially launched its first quantum data centre in Europe – and only its second one worldwide – in Ehningen. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, along with CEOs, experts, and journalists, attended the ceremony for what was presented as a groundbreaking step towards the future of technology. Quantum computers are extremely powerful computers that are expected to revolutionise our future. While regular computers use bits that can be either 0 or 1, quantum computers use qubits. Qubits can be both 1 and 0 at the same time, which means they can explore many possible outcomes all at once. Specifically, the Ehningen data centre has two Eagle processors, each with 127 qubits. But soon, IBM will be adding a third processor called Heron that will boost the centre’s performance. Heron has 156 qubits and it’s the most powerful quantum chip the company has made so far. “Heron was a completely new technology that we had to develop and that required completely different controls,” Jay Gambetta, vice president of IBM Quantum and IBM Fellow, told Euronews Tech Talks. The Heron processors are 16 times more powerful and can run up to 25 times faster, all while reducing error rates. “The hardest question that we need to answer as a community is how do we write algorithms?” Gambetta explained when asked about the purpose of the IBM data centre. This function will be highly beneficial to IBM's 250 partners, which include Credit Mutuelle, Bosch, and Eon. Ana Paula de Jesus Assis, chair and general manager of IBM Europe, Middle East, and Africa, told Euronews Tech Talks that these companies will resort to the IBM data centre and quantum computing to face practical challenges including how to improve risk management in insurance policies for housing, or how to make cars more performative and reduce emissions. IBM’s decision to establish its data centre in Ehningen does not come as a surprise. The German town is already home to an IBM campus and a quantum computer, and Baden-Württemberg, the region it is located in, is an industrial hub with a remarkable economic weight in Germany’s GDP. In 2023, Baden-Württemberg was Germany's largest exporter and in 2022, it held the distinction of being the German region with the highest investment in research and development. “It's an area that comprises a lot of companies in key industries that we believe are going to benefit from quantum computing like industrial plants, chemicals, materials, sciences,” Ana Paula de Jesus Assis said. On top of this, she highlighted that the EU is at the forefront of the quantum computing race. “When we look at the entire ecosystem of quantum, we expect that by 2025, there will be more than €1 billion of investment in Europe in this area,” she said. But how will European citizens practically benefit from the creation of this centre? Tune in to the podcast to find out the answer."
What's the best strategy to stay young based on astronaut research | Euronews Tech Talks,Marta Rodriguez Martinez,"25/09/2024,15:59 GMT+216:01",Euronews Tech Talks,Have you ever wondered what the most effective strategy is to stop accelerated ageing in astronauts and whether it could work on Earth? Tune into this episode of Euronews Tech Talks to find out.,"Travelling to space has been found to alter different parts of the human body, so what's the most effective strategy for combatting accelerated ageing in space? Astronauts offer a model for studying this and can provide insights into how these processes work and how to counter them. NASA carried out a 2016 experiment with identical twins Scott and Mark Kelly to highlight some of these effects. Scott spent nearly a year at the International Space Station (ISS), while Mark stayed on Earth, allowing scientists to compare their bodies. Before the mission, their telomeres, which protect the ends of chromosomes, were similar. Surprisingly, Scott’s telomeres were longer than his brother’s during spaceflight. He joked about coming back younger, but upon his return, his telomeres shortened rapidly, leaving him with shorter telomeres than before. In addition to these telomere changes, Scott also experienced muscle loss, bone density reduction, and vision problems – all symptoms linked to ageing on Earth. Microgravity and radiation are two factors that contribute to accelerated ageing in space. ""Microgravity impacts our body because it's designed to operate under Earth's gravity,"" says Christiane Hahn, a project scientist at the European Space Agency (ESA). ""Without this constant stimulus, our physiology is deeply affected"". Radiation is also damaging, she adds: ""Our DNA is sensitive to radiation. If DNA changes, cell function changes, impacting our entire physiology"". So how do astronauts counter these forces? Research shows that exercise is the only proven strategy. In 2016, the ESA conducted a bedrest study to test whether vitamins, antioxidants, and supplements could prevent muscle and bone loss. They found that the cocktail didn’t help much. Astronauts work out two hours a day to combat, for example, the 1–2 per cent monthly bone density loss in microgravity. ""It mimics ageing on Earth,"" says Hahn. ""After age 30, people lose about 3–8 per cent muscle mass each decade, and bone density declines after age 50"". The European Space Agency is preparing to launch its first reusable space vehicle, the Space Rider, an autonomous lab that can stay in orbit for up to three months. Set to revolutionise drug discovery in space, it will be Europe’s first lab of its kind, allowing companies to test experiments in microgravity. It holds particular promise for orphan drugs, medicines for rare diseases, by significantly cutting costs related to development, manufacturing, and testing. ""The microgravity environment is ideal for developing potential cures and new medicines,"" says an ESA representative. ""Space Rider accelerates the research cycle, allowing for faster testing and adjustments""."
How the first astronaut with a disability is preparing to travel into space | Euronews Tech Talks,"Marta Rodriguez Martinez
                                            & Jeremy Wilks","16/09/2024,8:00 GMT+2",Euronews Tech Talks,"In this episode, we will explore how space exploration affects the human body and how scientific research is fundamental to advancing medicine here on Earth.","John McFall is the subject matter expert for a European Space Agency study aimed at fully integrating an astronaut with a physical disability into a long-duration mission to the International Space Station. He is also the first world's astronaut candidate with a physical disability. In 2000, John McFall’s life took a sharp turn when he lost his leg in a motorcycle accident. But for McFall, a British athlete, surgeon, and now astronaut, the loss became a catalyst for a remarkable journey that would take him from elite sports to the frontiers of space exploration. In 2008, he won a bronze medal in the 100 metres at the Beijing Paralympic Games and his ambitions didn’t stop there. In 2022, the European Space Agency (ESA) selected him as the first astronaut with a disability. His groundbreaking role as part of the ESA’s Fly! Feasibility Study represents a significant step forward in making space exploration more inclusive. McFall’s work focuses on determining what is required for astronauts with physical disabilities, like his lower limb amputation, to participate in long-duration space missions. “Like many kids, I dreamed of astronauts in big white suits floating in space,” McFall said. Now, he’s helping make that dream a reality - not just for himself, but for others with disabilities. As the Subject Matter Expert for the Fly! Study, McFall’s expertise is invaluable in exploring how someone with a prosthetic limb can thrive in the challenging environment of space. The study has already uncovered significant challenges. Current spacecraft hardware is not designed with disabilities in mind, which means existing safety and emergency protocols must be adapted. However, McFall is optimistic that future technological innovations will lead to more inclusive space travel. “We’re looking into new socket technologies that could be more robust and easier to use,” McFall said, expressing hope that such advancements will not only benefit astronauts but improve prosthetics for people on Earth as well. McFall awaits the day when astronauts with disabilities will routinely travel into space. For him, the success of the Fly! Study will be realised when “someone with a disability returns from space"". And he’s excited about the possibility of being that person. McFall’s work builds on decades of space medicine research that has explored how space affects the human body. The earliest tests began in the late 1940s when the US and Soviet Union sent animals, like mice, monkeys, and fruit flies, into space to study how biological systems reacted to space conditions. In 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit the Earth, providing critical data on how microgravity impacts the human body. Later missions, including the 1969 Apollo moon landing, revealed key insights into how reduced gravity affects muscle atrophy, bone density loss, and cardiovascular health. These findings have directly contributed to medical advancements on Earth, particularly in the treatment of osteoporosis, muscle-wasting diseases, and heart conditions. The establishment of the International Space Station (ISS) in 2000 marked a new chapter in space medicine. The ISS allows astronauts to live in space for up to a year, providing scientists with an unparalleled opportunity to study the long-term effects of microgravity. One critical discovery is that microgravity causes significant changes in blood flow, heart function, and fluid distribution. These changes make astronauts’ hearts more spherical and reduce their ability to pump blood efficiently once they return to Earth. One of the most notable studies conducted on the ISS was the Kelly brothers’ Twin Study. In this study, astronaut Scott Kelly spent a year in space while his twin brother Mark remained on Earth. Researchers observed changes in Scott’s body, including an unexpected lengthening of his telomeres – protective caps on chromosomes that typically shorten with age and stress. Most of Scott’s changes reversed upon returning to Earth, but some, particularly in gene expression and vision, lasted longer. As space agencies continue to push the boundaries of human space exploration, studies like these, and McFall’s work, offer valuable insights into how the human body works also on Earth."

"'We will do our best to accelerate our European path,' Serbia's Vučić says",Euronews                      with AP,"25/10/2024,18:44 GMT+2",Europe News,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen visited Belgrade as part of her Balkan tour, where she reaffirmed Europe's commitment to Serbia's progress toward EU membership.","European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met with Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić in Belgrade on Friday to discuss Serbia's path toward the European Union. “Europe remains strongly committed to the European future of Serbia,” von der Leyen said after meeting with Vučić. ""In times of conflicts and wars and turmoil, being a member of the European Union is a promise of peace and prosperity, and it is a promise that we can deliver together,"" she added. The Commission President was in Serbia as part of a trip this week to aspiring EU member states in the Western Balkans, aiming to reassure them that EU enlargement remains a priority for the 27-nation bloc. Earlier on Friday she visited Bosnia where she promised support for the troubled Balkan nation as it struggles with reform needed to advance toward membership in the European Union. The Western Balkans countries — Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia — are at different stages in their applications for EU membership. The countries have expressed frustration over the slow pace of the process; however, Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has prompted European leaders to encourage the six nations to join the bloc. Last year EU officials offered a €6 billion growth plan to the Western Balkan countries in an effort to double the region’s economy over the next decade and accelerate their efforts to join the bloc. That aid is contingent on reforms that would bring their economies in line with EU rules. Vučić on Friday said Serbia would ""give our best"" to ""accelerate"" its path to joining the EU. Serbia became an EU candidate country in 2012. The Commission on Wednesday approved the reform agendas of Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia following a green light from EU member states. It was a key step to allow payments under the growth plan upon completion of agreed reform steps."
