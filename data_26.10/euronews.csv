Georgian PM Kobakhidze rejects Russian influence and embraces Europe ahead of elections,Jane Witherspoon,"25/10/2024,11:08 GMT+218:50",Georgia,"In an in-depth interview with Euronews, Georgia's PM Irakli Kobakhidze emphasizes the upcoming elections as crucial for EU integration and distancing from Russian influence, amid economic growth and political polarisation.","Georgia's Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze leaves the impression of a relaxed, yet composed and focused man. No big entourage in tow for our interview, he readily chatted about football, remembering a moment of pride over domestic legend Temur Ketsbaia, a former Newcastle United player, and pointing out there's a new, rising star at the same club. At the same time, Kobakhidze clearly knows what is at stake for his country in the upcoming parliamentary elections on Sunday — a pivotal, high-velocity moment as the outcome could potentially shape the nation’s future integration within the EU and its movement away from Russian influence. The political landscape in Georgia has become increasingly polarised, with opinion polls continuing to present unreliable and contradictory forecasts. This was particularly palpable in Tbilisi, where a big political rally was taking place on the same day as our interview: the roads were all being closed and stages set for the evening, as thousands were expected in the streets of the capital. While the ruling Georgian Dream party is framing the vote as a choice between ""peace and war"", opposition parties see the election as a battle between the democratic West and authoritarian Russia. Euronews spoke with Kobakhidze in an in-depth interview about the importance of the elections, given the backdrop of European Union accession talks and questions over Russian influences. Euronews: For you, as a young prime minister, what do you see as the future of Georgia? Irakli Kobakhidze: We are anticipating really crucial elections for Georgia. We are enjoying quite rapid development in our country, but there are still challenges. We are saying very directly and very explicitly that this election is also a referendum about the war and the peace issue. The Georgian Dream government, we believe, is the strongest guarantee for peace in this country, but it's also about the development of the country. Over the last two and a half years, we have enjoyed almost double-digit economic growth, and we had the highest growth not only in the region but also in Europe. The average economic growth in Georgia was around 9.7% in 2021, 2022 and 2023. And also this year's preliminary figure is 10% economic growth. So for us, keeping this trend is very important. We know that without proper economic figures Georgia will never be accepted as a member, a fully-fledged member, of the European Union. Euronews: What is the level of dialogue then with the EU in terms of your EU membership and what is the next stage of that for Georgia? Kobakhidze: Unfortunately, we are facing some challenges in terms of dialogue at the moment, but in general, if we summarise the outcomes of our policies, the Georgian Dream government has managed to achieve all the important steps towards European integration. We managed to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union back in 2014. We managed to sign the DCT with the European Union. We got the visa-free regime for our citizens. And finally the Georgian Dream government managed to get candidate status for Georgia. We strongly believe that as soon as these elections are over and as soon as the war in Ukraine is over, we will essentially improve and restart relations between Georgia and the EU and also between Georgia and the US. Euronews: As a Georgian, what does Europe mean to you, and what would it mean to be part of that club that is seen as the European Union? Kobakhidze: To be part of the European family is a kind of historic choice for Georgia and for Georgians. You know that we are a Christian nation and Europe was always associated with Christianity. It was defending it, protecting Christianity for Georgia. So that's why Europe was always a kind of natural choice for Georgia and for Georgians. And that is one of the, or the strongest reason, why we want to be a fully-fledged member of the European family. [Being in] Europe also means a higher level of prosperity which means development for Georgians. So that's why we are very much committed to this foreign policy priority of Georgia. Euronews: Are you pro-Russian or anti-European? Can you put it to rest once and for all for us? Kobakhidze: We are clearly pro-European as a government, and we have evidenced it by our actions. And again, there are very specific actions through which we have managed to move the country towards the EU. That's why there is no space for these kinds of manipulations from the opposition. That's their choice. That's their job. That's part of democracy. We will continue to do everything to promote Georgia's EU accession in the future. Euronews: As well as talking obviously, to the EU, which you all clearly are doing, you speak to governments all around the world. When was the last time you spoke to the Kremlin? Kobakhidze: We have no diplomatic relations with Russia. Georgia is maybe the only country in the region which has no diplomatic relations with Russia. And we have communication with our western partners in Europe and the US. That's the current state of affairs. Euronews: Well, this week, again, we've seen elections in other countries, and in particular Moldova, there was a lot of controversy in terms of Russia's involvement in the political process there. Will we see anything like that come here to Georgia? Kobakhidze: I can say that Russia is not influential in Georgia. There are no political parties in which they would have influence. There are no media channels with their influence. So that's why the Russian side cannot influence the elections in Georgia. Euronews: Looking in, it seems that you're matching certain Kremlin narratives in terms of some of the policies and laws that are being introduced here, such as the ""foreign agents"" and LGBTQ+ laws. Is that something that you would say is following in their footsteps? Kobakhidze: These are the decisions made by the Georgian government. And these decisions have nothing to do with the decisions made by the Russian government. We have introduced the Transparency Law, and the content of this law has nothing to do with the content of the Russian law about NGOs, its only about transparency. The other thing which is envisaged by this law is to ensure that the NGOs are publicising their annual financial declarations to the Minister of Justice, and that's it. There are no restrictions. That's why this messaging about the Russian law was completely fake. And the laws about LGBTI, that's also our national decision. Euronews: When it comes to war in Ukraine, there seems to have been a shift in tone. Is Georgia seeing this as an opportunity to have its independent voice heard? And if there is an opportunity there, what is it for you? Kobakhidze: Well, in general, we are strongly supporting Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and we have condemned the Russian military aggression many times. We have joined more than 600 international acts in support of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and condemning the Russian military aggression. So that's why we can say very firmly that our position with regard to the ongoing war in Ukraine is very strong. And of course, this position is based on international law standards. Euronews: Any war brings with it horrors that we see happening in Ukraine, and Georgia lost territories throughout history. How did that shape you as a person and a politician in terms of your policies throughout your career? Kobakhidze: We have a very complicated history, especially over the last 30 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union. But we have also learned a lot. And this experience is something that has helped us to avoid many problems over the last decade. And for me, as a politician, this experience is very useful and very important. Euronews: What does that mean for a country like Georgia that is surrounded by war? Kobakhidze: It puts us in a very complicated situation, of course. But again, despite all these challenges, we have managed to keep peace in the country. Euronews: How do you react to Western sanctions against Russia and what impact do they have on the region? Kobakhidze: The opposition was very much pushing us to join these sanctions, but we made a different decision and I can explain it very easily. The share of Georgian trade and the entire Russian trade is 0.3%. Of course, Georgia can not damage the Russian economy by introducing economic sanctions. At the same time, introducing sanctions would mean the escalation of the conflict. So that's why we had very strong grounds for not following the opposition's demand. But again, we are also doing our best not to let anybody to use Georgian territory to avoid the sanctions. Euronews: Let's talk trade and energy security, which is very important for this area. Where does Georgia play into that? The strategic location is crucial for Georgia, isn't it? Kobakhidze: Strengthening Georgia's connectivity is a key task for us, especially under the new geopolitical circumstances. For example, we have a very important strategic project which connects us with Azerbaijan and Turkiye. The Black Sea underwater electricity cable and the Internet cable projects will connect Georgia with the European market. And we are also investing a lot into the development of infrastructure. We have managed to build around 300 kilometres of highways in Georgia and now we have ordered the construction of a new port on the Black Sea. We are also constructing a new Tbilisi international airport and we are expanding the capacities of the Kutaisi International Airport."
Israel launches wave of retaliatory airstrikes against its enemy Iran,Euronews                      with AP,"26/10/2024,1:45 GMT+217:24",Iran,"Iran’s military said the strikes targeted military bases in Ilam, Khuzestan and Tehran provinces and caused 'limited damage,' without elaborating.","Israel attacked Iran with a series of pre-dawn airstrikes on Saturday in what it said was a response to the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired upon Israel earlier in the month. The Israeli military said its aircraft targeted facilities that Iran used to make missiles fired at Israel as well as surface-to-air missile sites. There was no immediate indication that oil or missile sites were hit — strikes that would have marked a much more serious escalation — and Israel offered no immediate damage assessment. Explosions could be heard in the Iranian capital, Tehran, though the Islamic Republic insisted they caused only “limited damage” and Iranian state-run media downplayed the attacks. The Iranian army said four soldiers were killed in Israeli strikes. It is possible that the number of dead may be higher as Iran seeks to downplay the attacks. The strikes risk pushing the arch-enemies closer to all-out war at a time of spiralling violence across the Middle East, where militant groups backed by Iran — including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — are already at war with Israel. “Iran attacked Israel twice, including in locations that endangered civilians, and has paid the price for it,” said Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari in a video statement. “We are focused on our war objectives in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. It is Iran that continues to push for a wider regional escalation.” The strikes marked the first time Israel's military has openly attacked Iran, which hasn't faced a sustained barrage of fire from a foreign enemy since its 1980s war with Iraq. It came as part of Israel's “duty to respond” to attacks on it from “Iran and its proxies in the region,” Hagari said. “The Israel Defence Forces has fulfilled its mission,” Hagari said. “If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond.” Israel offered no initial damage assessment. Iran’s state-run media acknowledged blasts that could be heard in Tehran and said some of the sounds came from air defence systems around the city. But beyond a brief reference, Iranian state television for hours offered no other details and even began showing what it described as live footage of men loading trucks at a vegetable market in Tehran in an apparent attempt to downplay the assault. A Tehran resident told The Associated Press that at least seven explosions could be heard in the first wave of attacks, which rattled the surrounding area. The resident spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. As explosions sounded, people in Tehran could see what appeared to be tracer fire light up the sky. Other footage showed what appeared to be surface-to-air missiles being launched. Iran closed the country’s airspace early on Saturday, and flight-tracking data analysed by AP showed commercial airlines had broadly left the skies over Iran, and across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. Iran's move to quickly downplay the attack may offer an avenue for it not to respond, which could risk a further escalation. Meanwhile, in seemingly unrelated violence, an attack on an Iranian police convoy on Saturday in the country's restive southern province of Sistan and Baluchestan killed at least 10 officers, authorities said. Details remain scarce over the attack in Gohar Kuh, some 1,200 kilometres southeast of the Iranian capital, Tehran. Initially, reports simply described an attack by “miscreants” without more information. But shortly after, Iranian state media said 10 officers had been killed. The White House indicated that Israel’s strikes on Iran should end the direct exchange of fire between the two enemy countries, while warning Tehran of “consequences” should it respond. A senior White House official said the administration believed the Israeli operation should “close out” the direct military exchange between Israel and Iran, and said other allies were in agreement. United States President Joe Biden was updated throughout Israel's operation, the official said, while underscoring that the U.S. had no involvement in the attack. The official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said the Israeli operation “was extensive, it was targeted, it was precise.” U.S. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, about Israel’s strikes on military targets in Iran, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said late Friday. Austin reiterated that the U.S. was committed to its ally’s security and that Israel has a right to defend itself, though Washington was determined to prevent the conflict from expanding, the Pentagon press secretary said in a statement. Israel and Iran have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel considers Iran to be its greatest threat, citing its leaders’ calls for Israel’s destruction, their support for anti-Israel militant groups and the country’s nuclear programme. During their years-long shadow war, a suspected Israeli assassination campaign has killed top Iranian nuclear scientists and Iranian nuclear installations have been hacked or sabotaged, all in mysterious attacks blamed on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran has been blamed for a series of attacks on shipping in the Middle East in recent years, which later grew into the attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. Meanwhile, Syrian state news agency SANA reported ""barrages of missiles from the direction of the occupied Syrian Golan and Lebanese territories targeted some military sites in the southern and central regions"" of Syria early on Saturday. It said Syria's air defences shot some missiles down, with no information immediately available on casualties. Iran has launched two ballistic missile attacks on Israel in recent months amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip that began with the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. That initial attack killed some 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage back to the seaside enclave. In the time since, more than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to Hamas-led local health officials."
Some elderly voters in rural Bulgaria can't reach polling stations,Kristiana Ivanova and Emma De Ruiter,"26/10/2024,15:08 GMT+215:23",Bulgaria,"In the small south-eastern town of Lisitsite, the largely elderly population has no easy way of accessing polling stations for the election on Sunday.","As Bulgarians prepare to vote for a new government on Sunday, residents in rural parts of the country have become disillusioned, and many don't plan to vote at all. In the rural town of Lisitsite, in the country's south, the less than 20 residents are not eager to vote. The town is so remote, many polling stations are hard to reach, and the residents have lost faith in their government to build better infrastructure. ""We have been asking for a road to this place for many years. I am 70 years old, since democracy came not one nail has been driven here, not one,"" says resident Mehmed Ahmed. Nestled in the hills of the Eastern Rhodopes, Lisitsite looks like a dream place to live, but the reality is different. The only way to reach it is by boat or through the neighbouring village of Shiroko Pole, by walking along a railway for nearly three kilometres. From there, the rope bridge leads to the village itself. Many people who live in Lisitsite are elderly, and don't see a point in voting.  ""People are walking with two walking sticks. Most of them are over 80 years old. Two or three years ago they used to go to vote, but now they can't go,"" says Ahmed. In Bulgaria's last election, in June, voter turnout stood at a record low, at just 34%. This Sunday's election is the seventh time people are voting for a new government in just three years. In 2020, mass anti-corruption protests in 2020 toppled a coalition government led by the centre-right GERB party. Since then, a series of elections have led to unstable coalitions led by multiple centrist and right-wing parties. Some observers have labelled the past few years as a period of ""revolving-door governments,"" which has led to considerable apathy amongst voters."
Western and regional leaders call on Iran to show 'restraint' after attack,"Daniel Bellamy
                  with AP","26/10/2024,13:44 GMT+217:50",Europe News,Western and Middle Eastern leaders urged Iran not to engage in escalations after Israel's retaliatory strikes against it early on Saturday.,"Germany's chancellor has responded to Israel's airstrikes on Iran early on Saturday, posting on X: ""My message to Iran is clear: We cannot continue with massive reactions of escalation. This must end now."" In a statement France's foreign ministry urged ""the parties to refrain from any escalation and action likely to aggravate the context of extreme tension prevailing in the region."" British prime minister Keir Starmer urged ""maximum restraint."" Meanwhile, in Washington DC, National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said the US was urging Iran ""to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation.” Israel said the airstrikes were a response to the barrage of ballistic missiles the Islamic Republic fired upon it earlier in the month. The Israeli military said its aircraft targeted facilities that Iran used to make missiles fired at Israel as well as surface-to-air missile sites. There was no immediate indication that oil or missile sites were hit — strikes that would have marked a much more serious escalation — and Israel offered no immediate damage assessment. In a statement the EU said: ""The dangerous cycle of attacks and retaliations risks causing a further expansion of the regional conflict."" ""While acknowledging Israel’s right to self-defence, the EU calls on all parties to exercise utmost restraint to avoid an uncontrollable escalation, which is in no one’s interest."" Saudi Arabia was one of multiple countries in the region condemning the strike, calling it a violation of Iran's ""sovereignty and a violation of international laws and norms.” The kingdom’s foreign ministry said it rejected the escalation in the region and “the expansion of the conflict that threatens the security and stability of the countries and people of the region.” The United Arab Emirates ""strongly condemned"" the strikes according to a statement put out by its foreign ministry. Turkey meanwhile accused Israel of having “brought our region to the brink of a greater war” following its strikes on Iran. “Putting an end to the terror created by Israel in the region has become a historic duty in terms of establishing international security and peace,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It also called on the international community to take “immediate action to enforce the law and stop the Netanyahu government.” Iran-backed Hamas called the attack “an escalation targeting the region's security and its people's safety.” But Israel’s opposition leader said the strikes on Iran didn't go far enough. Yair Lapid criticised the decision to avoid “strategic and economic targets"" in the attack. ""We could and should have exacted a much heavier price from Iran,” Lapid wrote on X."
Which European universities and countries file the most patent applications?,Alessio Dell'Anna,"23/10/2024,9:34 GMT+217:06",Europe in Motion,A new study shows a growing contribution of universities to the continent's innovation ecosystem but laments the bloc's fragmentation is crippling the ability to turn high-level scientific research into economic competitiveness.,"A new report by the European Patent Observatory (EPO) shows that patent submissions across the continent are concentrated in just a few places. Half of all direct and indirect patent applications submitted with the European Patent Office between 2000 and 2020 - on a total of over 100,000 - came from only 5% of all European universities. France's University of Grenoble was the most active, with 3,348 submissions, followed by Zurich's ETH (2,219) and Munich's Technical University (2,183). Overall, submissions were the highest in Europe's most industrialised regions, says the report, ""where opportunities for collaboration and technology transfers with industry are greatest."" In terms of countries, Germany submitted the most patent applications (24.09%). France ranks second, (17.97%), followed by the UK, (12.26%), and Italy (6.61%). However, smaller countries like Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Belgium, Finland, The Netherlands, and Belgium have the highest number of academic patents per university on average. The most active sectors have been pharmaceuticals (24,944 applications), biotechnology (22,870), measurement (22,870) and analysis of biological materials (8,832). The overall number of applications by European universities has increased steadily in recent decades, from 6.2% of all European patent applications in 2000 to 10.2% in 2019. The report however highlights a fundamental paradox affecting the European economy: Over 20% of patents filed were not exploited commercially. The European advantage in academic research ""has not been necessarily converted into applied technological and economic performance, compared to other advanced economies"" says the document. ""This is what is referred to as the 'European paradox': The difficulties of transforming science into commercialisation in Europe, despite the global leadership of European universities"" - (almost a third of the world's top 100 universities are European, according to the Shanghai Rankings). ""The fact that 10% of startups with European academic patents are headquartered in the US highlights the ongoing difficulties in commercialising new technologies within the EU single market"", researchers say. The biggest issues are market and policy fragmentation, lack of funding in university research and a sort of overall ""anti-risk sentiment"". The diversity of national models in academic patenting poses another challenge, as most knowledge gets only transferred to the local national or regional ecosystem. Mario Draghi's recent report on European competitiveness, as well as Enrico Letta’s on the Single Market's future, argued that such a fragmented ecosystem is to blame for Europe’s struggle in translating innovation into commercialisation. ""Nevertheless, the additional transaction costs tied to multiple national frameworks, and the ability of a few large companies to overcome these barriers by sourcing technology across borders, suggest there is potential for further harmonisation and integration in Europe’s markets for academic inventions."""
Would Donald Trump’s trade tariffs hurt Europe?,Mared Gwyn Jones,"24/10/2024,9:16 GMT+225/10/2024,12:58 GMT+2",EuroVerify,"The EU is increasingly reliant on the US export market, making it vulnerable to the potential shocks of Trump’s trade policy.","Donald Trump has a trade trick up his sleeve that he insists he’s not afraid to use if re-elected in November: a universal tariff of up to 20% on all foreign-imported products. “Outside of love and religion, it's the most beautiful word there is: tariff,” Trump told a North Carolina rally on Monday. A tariff is a tax levied on foreign goods as they enter a country, with the domestic importer expected to foot the bill, at least on paper. Trump has threatened to levy a 60% duty on Chinese products and up to 200% on cars produced in bordering Mexico. The Republican hopeful is counting on the trade tool to propel homegrown US businesses, create jobs and shrink the federal deficit through extra tax revenues. But his critics at home are warning that the economic burden of such tariffs could be passed on to American consumers, while allies abroad — including in Europe — fear the collateral damage of Trump’s tariffs could be devastating. The EU-US trading relationship is the most valuable in the world, worth around €1 trillion in goods and services annually. The EU benefits most from trade in goods, posting a surplus of €156 billion last year alone, against a deficit in services of €104 billion. A blanket tariff of 10% or 20% would make it more expensive for American companies to import EU goods, meaning EU exports across the Atlantic could plunge by as much as a third in some sectors, according to the most radical economic estimates. Sectors such as machinery, vehicles and chemicals — which together made up 68% of EU exports to the US last year — would be hardest hit. It would make Germany, the European bloc’s economic powerhouse, especially vulnerable to shocks, given its reliance on US exports in these sectors. While economists disagree on the extent of the damage, most agree Trump's tariffs would deal a devastating blow to Europe's economy. An across-the-board tariff of 10% would lower the eurozone’s GDP by 1%, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. More radical predictions say Trump's tariffs would make eurozone growth 1.5% lower by 2028. Such a scenario would push the economy — which is already under pressure — to the brink of a recession. Other economists estimate that a 10% tariff could at worst slice off up to 1.6% of Germany’s GDP, while the impact on other major economies such as Spain would be considerably lower at 0.5%. The after-shocks could also include job losses. Transatlantic trade and investment is estimated to directly support around 9.4 million jobs in both the EU and the US, according to European Commission estimates. But the bloc has been reinforcing its trade defence arsenal in recent years, including in response to the steep tariffs imposed by Trump on €6.4 billion in EU steel and aluminium during his first presidency. The trans-Atlantic trade truce that temporarily resolved that Trump-era dispute is due to expire on March 21, 2025, just two months before the next US administration takes office. Trump's vow to slap a 60% tariff on Chinese imported goods poses a real risk the EU could be dragged into an all-out trade war. “A tariff on Chinese goods entering the US would inevitably cause many products to be redirected to the European market,” André Sapir, a senior fellow at Bruegel and former economic advisor to European Commission President Romano Prodi, told Euronews. “The EU would need to respond to that with retaliatory measures. It would need to protect itself.” It could see trade tensions between Brussels and Beijing, which have escalated after an EU decision to impose steep tariffs on China-made electric vehicles, flare up even more. “The EU hasn't been doing what the US has in terms of decoupling from China and reducing imports. This is one of the few things that's been keeping the European economy afloat,” Zach Meyers, assistant director at the Centre for European Reform (CER), explained. “But how long will the US continue to allow Europe to straddle both horses at the same time? I think it’s a difficult question,” he added. The bloc would likely look to strike a deal with Trump before opting for retaliatory tariffs, analysts say. “The EU and others will be keen to offer Trump a carrot, something to give him the facade of saying that he's gotten away with a huge success,” Meyers said. “This is exactly what we saw under the Trump presidency, where you had both the Commission President and Chinese leaders signing these agreements to buy up American goods.” Trump’s own economic advisors could consider limiting his tariff ambitions to avoid potential economic turmoil at home. Economists say the move would inevitably lead to a spike in inflation and that US importing firms could decide to pass on the cost of tariffs to American citizens."

After the Israeli strikes what will Iran do next?,Babak Kamiar,"26/10/2024,11:57 GMT+212:58",Iran,The Iranian government said on Saturday morning that the damage from the airstrikes was 'limited' and that the 'situation is normal.',"After Israel launched a wave of airstrikes against Iran, domestic media and sources close to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) are attempting to downplay it, saying it was a failure. While Israel reports that at least 20 military sites were effectively targeted in a three-phase operation early on Saturday, Iranian semi-official sources have dismissed claims of 140 Israeli fighter jets being involved as “exaggerated Israeli propaganda.” They are also emphasising to Iranians that Israeli leaders directed the attack from bunkers, purportedly out of fear of potential Iranian retaliation. Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokeswoman for the Iranian government, limited her statement on the damage from the airstrikes, saying it was “limited” and that the “situation is normal.” The regime is also trying to stop photo and video of the damage from the airstrikes reaching the outside world. The Organised Crime Investigation Centre, a subdivision of the IRGC, issued a statement warning Iranian not to cooperate with foreign media, or else face a ten year prison sentence: ""Citizens are informed that any sending of images or news to opposition media or those affiliated with the Zionist regime is considered a crime."" But despite this threat, videos and images of the attack on Israel were shared on social media. As Washington had desired, Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu appears to have opted for a more limited series of retaliatory strikes on conventional military targets. Nuclear facilities and oil installations had been seen as possible targets for Israel’s response to Iran’s Oct. 1 attack, before U.S. President Joe Biden's administration won assurances from Israel in mid-October that it would not hit such targets, which would be a more severe escalation. The United States has now warned against further retaliation, indicating that the overnight strikes should end the direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran. In reality, Israel’s focus on specific military targets, whilst not ideal for the Islamic Republic, was far from the worst-case scenario. A more extensive attack on critical infrastructure—such as oil, electricity, or nuclear facilities—could have driven Iran into even deeper crisis amid the current economic and political instability. US media had earlier noted that if Israel’s response remained limited, Iran would likely refrain from retaliating. The New York Times also reported that Iranian officials have clarified they would respond if Israel’s attacks caused extensive damage and high casualties; however, if Israel kept its strikes to a few military bases and storage facilities for missiles and drones, Iran might opt not to take any counter-action. Iran finds itself in a precarious position, particularly as its regional proxy forces, notably Hezbollah in Lebanon, are significantly weakened.  The regime is aware, at least behind the scenes, that it lacks the military capability to match Israel, which receive billions of euros' worth of US military aid each year. While it is improbable that Iran would officially renounce its right to retaliate, an immediate response does not appear to align with its strategic interests. In the short term, Iranian media and state television will likely emphasise a narrative of “victory” while downplaying or even dismissing some aspects of Israel's retaliatory strike as “fake.” The Iranian regime will likely conceal any damage to ballistic missile production facilities or drone manufacturing plants, capitalising on the limited and perhaps coordinated nature of Israel’s response to control the situation. Of course, concealing the truth is nothing new in Iranian politics, with many examples like the downing of the Ukrainian airplane or Israel's response to Iran's first attack on Israeli soil in April 2024. Regarding Israel’s attack on the Isfahan facility, only a few days ago and for the first time, a senior IRGC commander finally acknowledged the occurrence of this strike. While Iran is expected to maintain the rhetoric of a potential response, it will likely navigate a delicate balance between escalating and de-escalating tensions. Moreover, it is essential to remember that the upcoming U.S. election, less than ten days away, will significantly influence the future policies of both Iran and Israel, and it seems unlikely that the White House would allow tensions to spiral in the remaining days—a prospect that could prompt Iran to shelve the issue for now—a restraint possibly hinted at by Iran’s implicit assurance to stabilise Lebanon and Gaza, which could encourage Tehran to keep the matter quiet. However, the influence of those who benefit from sanctions and the hardliners within Iran’s ruling circles, who see full-scale conflict as their only path to political survival, should not be underestimated either."
At least 126 dead or missing in massive flooding and landslides in Philippines,"Daniel Bellamy
                  with AP","26/10/2024,17:48 GMT+2",Philippines,The number of dead and missing in massive flooding and landslides wrought by Tropical Storm Trami in the Philippines has reached nearly 130.,"President Ferdinand Marcos said on Saturday that many areas remained isolated and that rescue efforts were ongoing. Marcos, who inspected another hard-hit region southeast of Manila on Saturday, said the unusually large volume of rainfall dumped by the storm — including in some areas that saw one to two months’ worth of rainfall in just 24 hours — overwhelmed flood controls in provinces lashed by Trami. ""The water was just too much,” Marcos told reporters. “We’re not done yet with our rescue work,” he said. “There are still many areas that remained flooded and could not be accessed even big trucks."" His administration, Marcos said, would plan to start work on a major flood control project that can meet the unprecedented threats posed by climate change. Trami blew away from the north-western Philippines on Friday, leaving at least 85 people dead and 41 others missing in in one of the Southeast Asian archipelago’s deadliest and most destructive storms so far this year, the government’s disaster-response agency said. The death toll was expected to rise as reports come in from previously isolated areas. Dozens of police, firefighters and other emergency personnel, backed by three backhoes and sniffer dogs, dug up one of the last two missing villagers in the lakeside town of Talisay in Batangas province Saturday. A father, who was waiting for word on his missing 14-year-old daughter, wept as rescuers placed the remains of one person in a black body bag. Distraught, he followed police officers, who carried the body bag down a mud-strewn village alley to a police van. The man said he was sure it was his daughter, but authorities needed to do checks to confirm the identity of the villager dug up in the mound. In a nearby basketball gym at the town centre, more than a dozen white coffins were laid side by side, bearing the remains of those found in the heaps of mud, boulders and trees that cascaded Thursday afternoon down the steep slope of a wooded ridge in Talisay's Sampaloc village. More than five million people were in the path of the storm, including nearly half a million who mostly fled to more than 6,300 emergency shelters in several provinces, the government agency said. In an emergency Cabinet meeting, Marcos raised concerns over reports by government forecasters that the storm — the 11th to hit the Philippines this year — could make a U-turn next week as it is pushed back by high-pressure winds in the South China Sea. It was forecast to batter Vietnam over the weekend, if it doesn't veer off course. The government had shut down schools and government offices for the third day on Friday to keep millions of people safe on the main northern island of Luzon. Inter-island ferry services were also suspended, stranding thousands. Weather has cleared in many areas on Saturday, allowing clean-up work in most areas. Each year, about 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines, a Southeast Asian archipelago which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing and flattened entire villages."
Daylight saving ends in Europe this weekend. Experts warn the time change could harm your health,Imane El Atillah,"26/10/2024,10:30 GMT+214:37",Health news,"Most of Europe will end daylight saving time this weekend, turning clocks back by one hour. But what are the potential health impacts of this practice?","Clocks in multiple countries in Europe will move back one hour early on Sunday, marking the end of daylight saving time. This seasonal time shift happens twice a year, switching to daylight saving time (DST) in the spring, when clocks move forward one hour, and returning to standard time in the fall. Although the clock change has been a standardised practice for years and is common in most of Europe and the United States, and parts of Canada, Australia, and Latin America, health experts warn it may be harmful to people’s well-being. Earlier this week, a team of sleep researchers from the British Sleep Society published a position statement urging the UK government to abolish the twice-yearly clock changes. The statement, published in the Journal of Sleep Research, advocates for adopting standard time year-round as it aligns more closely with “the natural light-dark cycles of the day and night”. “Restoring permanent Standard Time would mean our clocks would be closely aligned to solar time, and while it would mean earlier sunsets in the summer, there would be additional benefits to health from improved sleep and circadian alignment due to increased exposure to morning sunlight from autumn to spring,” Malcolm von Schantz, professor of chronobiology at Northumbria University and a member of the Northumbria Centre for Sleep Research, said in a statement. The researchers added that maintaining a good sleep routine and exposure to natural daylight in the morning are important components of human health and disruptions to either of these factors could lead to negative health effects. “If you aren't getting that morning light exposure then you're not regulating your body clock as well as you could be, and there's really sort of a specific time in the morning that you need that light exposure in order to help regulate your body clock, and that allows you to fall asleep early enough at night,” Dr Megan Crawford, senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Strathclyde and lead author of the statement, told Euronews Health. “If you're not doing that, you're kind of burning the candle at both ends, and then you're losing that sleep at night, you're getting poor quality of sleep, and poor quality sleep is linked to a lot of health outcomes, mental health as well as physical health,” she added. One main reason the experts provide in favour of discontinuing seasonal time change is its impact on the human circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm is the body’s biological clock, which operates on a 24-hour cycle, and according to the researchers, plays a role in regulating essential bodily functions, including sleep, hormone release, metabolism, and mood. The disturbances that come from gaining or losing an hour of sleep interfere with the natural sleep cycle and affect these functions. Crawford explained that while the time change ""doesn't really make a difference"" in summer, when sunrises are still very early, the same isn’t true in other seasons. “In spring and autumn, the sunrise is a little bit later, so by getting up an hour earlier we may be getting up in the dark. And that's really problematic because we need morning sunlight in order to regulate our body clocks and for optimal sleep,” she said. Well-timed light exposure keeps the circadian cycle aligned to the 24-hour day as the morning light promotes natural waking and enables early sleep onset in the evening, the statement said. However, exposure to light at night, which could happen during time shifts, makes it harder to fall asleep and wake up on time. Multiple scientific studies have also found evidence of increased adverse health consequences following the time shift. For instance, a meta-analysis based on seven studies involving more than 100,000 participants found that there was a significantly higher risk of heart attacks, in the weeks following spring and autumn DST transitions. Another study by researchers in Finland found that hospitalisations for stroke increased in the first two days following the time change. Research has also linked it to rises in mental health issues and mood disturbances, especially in vulnerable individuals, including an increase in suicide rates in the weeks following the start of daylight saving time. Crawford attributed the resistance to ending time changes to a “lack of understanding,” emphasising that the benefits of extended evening daylight in the summer would remain, regardless of whether DST is used. ""A lot of people think that Daylight Saving Time gives them more sunlight or more daylight, but that won't change. The sun won't change just because we're changing our schedules"". In 2018, the European Commission proposed ending the twice-yearly clock shifts in the European Union. As part of the proposal, it also conducted an online consultation to determine the views of EU residents on the topic. Support for ending the clock changes was significant, with rates ranging from as high as 95 per cent in Poland and Finland to 44 per cent in Greece. The responses showed that an overwhelming majority of respondents favoured putting an end to the practice, with an average of 84 per cent of people across the EU supporting the change. However, while the European Parliament voted in favour of adopting the change, the European Council has not agreed to it, and DST transitions have continued."

Israeli airstrike killed journalists covering the war in Lebanon as they slept,Euronews                      with AP,"26/10/2024,1:06 GMT+2",Lebanon,The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was appalled by the killing of the three journalists and called for an independent investigation.,"An Israeli airstrike hit guesthouses where journalists were staying in southeast Lebanon on Friday, killing three media staffers from two different news agencies according to Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency. It was a rare airstrike on an area that has been used by the media as a base for covering the war. The airstrike turned buildings used by media outlets covering the war into rubble with cars marked “PRESS” being overturned and covered in dust and debris. The Israeli army did not issue a warning prior to the strike, which it said targeted Hezbollah militant infrastructure. The military later said the strike was being reviewed. Several journalists have been killed since a near-daily exchange of fire began along the Lebanon-Israel border on October 8, 2023. Lebanon’s health ministry says the total toll over the past year is over 2,500 killed and 12,000 wounded with 1.2 million Lebanese people reportedly driven from their homes, including 400,000 children, according to the United Nations. Two people in Israel died of their wounds after a rocket attack from Hezbollah militants in Lebanon on Friday, the country’s rescue services said. Rocket shrapnel hit the Israeli town of Majd Al-Krum, with a further seven people being injured. Militants in Lebanon fired 45 projectiles into Israel on Friday. Some were intercepted by Israel’s air defences whilst others reportedly fell into open areas. Earlier on Friday, Israeli attack on the Gazan city of Khan Younis left at least 38 people dead. The strikes came a day after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Israel had accomplished its objective of “effectively dismantling” Hamas and urged both sides to resume negotiations. During his visit to Qatar, he expressed hope for the revival of ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas in the coming days. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians according to local health authorities."
At least one killed and several injured after Russian drone attack on residential Kyiv building,Euronews,"26/10/2024,0:07 GMT+2",Ukraine,Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said a teenage girl was killed in the late-night Russian attack.,"At least one person was reportedly killed and five injured after a Russian drone hit a 25-story residential building in Kyiv on Friday night. Emergency responders were dispatched to the site of the attack to fight a fire which broke out on the upper floor of the building due to the strike. The fire was extinguished but a search and rescue operation continued, according to Kyiv’s major Vitali Klitschko. Klitschko said one of the five injured was sent to hospital and that a first aid tent was set up at the site. Ukraine’s Emergency Service say the attack damaged several apartments in the building with around 100 people being evacuated after the drone struck. “Apartments from the 17th to the 21st storeys were damaged in the apartment building in Solomyanskyi district,” Serhiy Popko, head of the Ukrainian capital’s military administration wrote on Telegram, “Apartments were on fire on the 20th floor.” Prior to the attack, local media report an air alert had been sounded in Kyiv and other Ukrainian regions due to a mass Russian drone attack – a near-daily occurrence in Ukraine for over a month. Air defence units were reportedly deployed during the hour-long air raid alert."
Revealed: These were the 10 best companies to work for in Europe in 2024,Imane El Atillah,"26/10/2024,12:38 GMT+212:39",Work,Fortune has released its 2024 list of 100 best companies to work for in Europe. Which ones made the top 10 and why did employees rate them so highly?,"When it comes to professional work, Europe is recognised for having one of the most favourable approaches globally. European countries consistently rank among the best for work-life balance, were some of the first to trial the four-day workweek, and offer some of the highest average salaries in the world, along with other employee benefits. But which companies on the continent are the best to work for? Fortune and Great Place To Work have published the ""Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For Europe"" list, which was compiled by analysing more than 1.3 million survey responses from over 2 million employees across Europe. The companies that topped the list had employees who were both more motivated to work and more comfortable with their company's way of working. For instance, according to a blog by Great Place To Work, their market study found that, in high-ranking companies, nearly 90 per cent of workers reported that they put in extra effort to get the job done, compared to only 59 per cent at a typical European workplace. They also found that camaraderie was a driving factor, with workers being 108 per cent more likely to give extra effort if they felt a sense of cooperation with their colleagues. Moreover, 86 per cent of employees at these top workplaces expressed plans to stay long-term, compared to just 60 per cent at other workplaces, which was particularly relevant among those who felt their work was meaningful and provided them with a sense of purpose. Also the report found that innovation rates were 66 per cent higher at the top workplaces and were mainly driven by continuous training and development opportunities the companies were providing. Here’s a look at the 10 best companies to work for in Europe according to the latest Fortune listing. Work-life balance was also a key factor behind the higher rankings of companies and one of the aspects that workers valued most. A high percentage of workers, about 85 per cent, who work at one of the best companies, said they were encouraged to maintain a balance between their work and personal lives, with 92 per cent reporting that they were able to take time off when necessary. Fairness in the workplace also played a significant role and contributed to the higher rankings of some companies. Employees at those companies reported that promotions were fair (78 per cent), they received a fair share of company profits (70 per cent), and their managers did not play favourites among their staff (81 per cent). This sense of fairness was also linked to employees' willingness to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) tools in their work. Only around one in three respondents (34 per cent) from the whole European study said they were excited to use AI to improve their work; the report also found that those who believed their companies were fair were 29 per cent more likely to be excited to use AI tools. While European workers are still reluctant to adopt AI, the technology sector in general is not a dominant force in Europe when it comes to jobs. This contrasts with the US, where tech companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google are among the best and have emerged as early winners in the AI boom. In Europe, however, many of the leading companies are from more traditional industries such as fossil fuels, automotive, and finance, as shown in the recent Fortune 500 list. Topping the list, Europe’s biggest company was German car manufacturer Volkswagen, followed by two oil and gas companies, Britain’s Shell and France’s TotalEnergies. According to Fortune, while only 15 companies in this year’s list are from the tech sector, legacy businesses are also opening the door to innovation by adopting automation technologies. For instance, Volkswagen announced earlier this year the integration of AI chatbot ChatGPT into the voice assistant in some of its vehicles. Additionally, the fossil fuel company Shell has also embraced the use of AI in its operations, like using AI-based technology in deep-sea exploration and production, with the aim of improving operational efficiency, speeding up processes, and increasing production."
"The best things to do, hear, see or watch in Europe this week",Amber Louise Bryce,"26/10/2024,9:40 GMT+2",Culture news,"Exhibitions from Tim Burton and Superflat supremo Mr., Venom returns to cinemas and new album releases from the Pixies and Laura Marling - here's what to consume in Europe this (extra spooky) week.","Happy Halloween, guys and ghouls [insert maniacal laugh]. Ok, so it's technically not Halloween yet, but seeing as this is the last digest before the year's spookiest evening, we're bringing you a special edition tinged with terror and terrible puns. Fans of Tim Burton have a lot to scream about, with the final stop of his world-touring exhibition arriving in London. Also in London - a fantastic new show by the artist Fin DAC that celebrates his creative influences (although it ends 26 October, so be quick!) Elsewhere, Dutch Design Week continues, while a groundbreaking new retrospective in Venice focuses on Op Art pioneer Marina Apollonio. If you'd prefer to hide away in the cinema, we'd recommend Smile 2 for some seasonal scare-themed viewing - or there's the newly released Venom: The Last Dance for pure escapism. Whether you're heading to a costume party, carving pumpkins or just turning off all the lights and tucking into toffee apples, have a lovely weekend - filled with treats only. ‘The World of Tim Burton’ at the Design Museum (London, UK) Nothing says “it’s showtime” on spooky season like a Tim Burton exhibition. From Beetlejuice to Edward Scissorhands to Corpse Bride to so many more, the filmmaker has crafted some of modern cinema's most iconic and idiosyncratic movies, defined by their unique kooky goth aesthetic. Fresh off his most recent release, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Burton has leant his personal archive of drawings, paintings, photographs, sketchbooks, set and costume designs, and more to London’s Design Museum. This vast and varied exhibition explores the evolution of a creator's aesthetic, tracing Burton’s personal life through to his modern day career. It’s an absolute must-see for fans - and also the final showing of what has been a decade-long world touring exhibit, ending 21 April 2025. Marina Apollonio: ‘Beyond the Circle’ at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection (Venice, Italy) The Italian artist Marina Apollonio has always understood the shape of things to come, a pivotal figure in the Op Art and kinetic art movements of the 60s. Her spiralling geometric designs that swallow your sight with optical illusion have become defining pieces of 20th century art, given major recognition after American art collector Peggy Guggenheim commissioned a piece in 1968. Coming full circle, it’s appropriate then that this retrospective of Apollonio’s works now be on show at the Peggy Guggenheim Collective. Hundreds of paintings, sculptures, drawings, chromatic experimentations and more contextualise Apollonio’s career from 1963 to the present day. For those in the know and newbies alike, it’s a fantastic way to experience such influential art while learning about the artist behind it all. On until 3 March 2025. Mr.: 'Those that Bring Color to Life and Living' at Lehmann Maupin's Cork street pop-up (London, UK) Best known for his Superflat style involving shaped-canvas paintings infused with anime and manga, Japanese artist Mr. is a former protégé of Takashi Murakami, concerned with exploring Japanese culture and its undercurrents of obsessiveness, commercialisations, consumerism and fetishisation. In this debut solo UK show, both print and motion works collaborate and contrast to create a contemporary contemplation of the circulation of pop culture imagery, its role in escapism and how it helped define postwar Japanese youth culture in particular. On until 16 November 2024. Venom: The Last Dance The sticky black liquid antihero is back for this third instalment in the Venom series, following 2018’s Venom and 2021’s Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Tom Hardy plays the pivotal role as Eddie Brock, the unfortunate host to our alien symbiote after it tried (and failed) to bond with Spiderman prior (remember Toby Maguire’s ‘dark spidey’ rizz in Spider-Man 3?) Picking up from the events of the last movie, in which the pair took on a red symbiote named Carnage, wrecked everything in the process (these poor city councils in superhero land, honestly) and went on the run from authorities. As with all Marvel films, expect sardonic quips, high-octane action and slimy special effects that bring this particular franchise to a fitting finale - for now. Three Kilometres to the End of the World Here’s a film festival gem you might not have heard of - and one that should definitely be on your watchlist. Directed by Emanuel Pârvu and set in a remote Romanian village, it’s an astute observation of a family caught in the throes of various struggles. Dragoi (Bogdan Dumitrache) is saddled with debt and then discovers his 17-year-old son Adi (Ciprian Chiujdea) is gay - something he responds to badly. What unfolds is a tense exploration of community-formed bubbles, and the ways in which their deeply embedded strictures and stigmas can tear us into two. Our reviewer David Mouriquand selected it as his Film of the Week and wrote: ""Trei kilometri până la capătul lumii (Three Kilometres to the End of the World), shows that the actor-turned-director is one of the brightest stars of the new wave of Romanian filmmaking."" Read his full review here. The Room Next Door Beginning its European rollout in Spain and now the UK and Germany, Almodóvar's first English-language feature film (and Golden Lion winner at Venice Film Festival) is a powerful portrait of life, death and the unbreakable bonds that help us to navigate it all. Based on Sigrid Nunez's novel, ""What Are You Going Through"", it focuses on the relationship between two old friends: Ingrid (Julianne Moore), an autofiction writer who is terrified of death, and Martha (Tilda Swinton) who has terminal cancer and makes the decision to end her life with a euthanasia pill. Powerful and pop-coloured, it’s an important watch buttressed by great lead performances, even if some of the emotional authenticity gets lost in translation at points. Read our full review here. ‘The Disappearance of Kimmy Diore’ (Disney+) Investigating the case of a kidnapped 6-year-old YouTuber named Kimmy, detective Sara Roussel (Géraldine Nakache) soon finds herself immersed in the seemingly superficial world of social media influencers, within which lurks a sinister underbelly of deception and conceit. Fresh feeling and highly bingeable, this French crime drama tackles a growing topic of concern: the exploitation of child ""influencers"" who are managed by their parents - and its potentially catastrophic effects. 'Rivals' (Disney+) Is it just us or is it warm in here? Another TV recommendation from Disney+ — and it's a steamy one. Based on a 1988 novel of the same name by Jilly Cooper, this raucous romp of a show centres on a rivalry between Rupert Campbell-Black (Alex Hassell) and media mogul Lord Tony Baddingham (David Tennant), all set to the hot and heavily hair-sprayed garish kitsch of the 80s. The cast is stacked, also featuring Katherine Parkinson, Danny Dyer and Emily Atack, but the main pull is all the sexy bits (and there are many), providing pure soapy silliness that comes together (literally) as the perfect bed-rot-and-soul-cheer viewing. Laura Marling: ‘Patterns in Repeat’ Laura Marling is one of those rare singers that can capture such gentle folky warmth with sharp poetic profundities in her music. First discovered as a teenager, Marling has gone on to produce eight studio albums, with 'Patterns in Repeat' being her newest - following the 2020 release of 'Song for Our Daughter'. In the time between the two, she gave birth to her daughter, writing music about the experience of motherhood and personal revelations that have come with it. The sound is awash with silky emotion and lulling melodies that give you goosebumps. Read our full review here. Pixies: ‘The Night the Zombies Came’ It's difficult to remain cool - especially if you're a defining band of the 90s alt-rock scene, enshrined in a specific period of success that harshens and heightens attempts to evolve outside of it. Unfortunately for the Pixies, this trope has proven true, with much of their album releases since reuniting in 2004 proving unmemorable and critically dismissed. Their latest - the appropriately Halloweeny titled 'The Night the Zombies Came' - feels like a return to more familiar ground and trademark haunted sound; moody surf rock for vibing out in cigarette butt-strewn basements. Lady Gaga: 'Disease' ‘Little Monsters’ (the name for Lady Gaga fans FYI) will be roaring with excitement as the singer has released the first single from her upcoming album (rumoured to be called 'Nightingale'). It's her first pop single in a while, with 2020's 'Chromatica' being the last and two jazz records following: 2021's 'Love for Sale' and her recently release companion piece to Joker: Folie à Deux, 'Harlequin'. To be fair, she's been busy - but the good news is, Gaga's return to dark dance-pop screams with haunted house party fun - and is much more likely to inspire ""a happy face"" than Joker 2."
