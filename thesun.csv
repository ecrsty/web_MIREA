"Movie producer Bradley Thomas filed for divorce & custody of kids before aristocrat wife fell from balcony, records show","Isabelle Thomas took her own life at 39, but mystery and heartbreak still surround her death","Emma Parry, Senior Reporter","12:16, 26 Oct 2024","12:56, 26 Oct 2024","News,US News","AN Oscar-nominated film producer was divorcing his wife at the time she plunged to her death from the upper floor of a Los Angeles hotel in January, The U.S. Sun has learned. Movie mogul Bradley Thomas, who was nominated for an Oscar for Killers of the Flower Moon, filed for divorce from English heiress Isabelle Thomas four months earlier in September 2023. On September 15, 2023, the 58-year-old, twice-married producer requested a divorce citing ""irreconcilable differences"" and asked for legal and physical custody of the couple's three-year-old twins, court papers reveal. Isabelle, who was 39, was told she had 30 days to file a response, and she was not allowed to take her children out of state, according to the documents. Isabelle did not attend a case review conference on December 13 at the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles. Court filings state that lawyers for Bradley requested ""additional time to serve Respondent and file Proof of Service of Summons"" at the hearing, and the case was placed on hold. Isabelle never filed a response. On January 29, she was found dead in the pool area of the Hotel Angeleno in Brentwood after falling from an upper-floor balcony. Los Angeles County Medical Examiners announced that Isabelle had ""multiple traumatic injuries"" and recorded the death as a suicide. The case is listed as closed, although the department states that the full report will not be available until it has been ""finalized."" It is understood that Isabelle did not leave a note. On February 1, three days after his wife's death, attorneys for Bradley filed a request to dismiss the divorce case without prejudice. Mystery and heartbreak still surround Isabelle's death. Although the court papers state that the couple separated on September 5, 2023, they were pictured together afterward, including at the BAFTA tea party on January 13, 2024. Writing after her death, Deadline reporter Mike Fleming Jr. also said he had just seen the couple at an Apple Golden Globes party. It's unclear whether the couple were trying to salvage the marriage at the time of her death. Bradley has been a successful producer since the 1990s as part of the team behind Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, and Me Myself & Irene Isabelle was the daughter of Henry Lawrence, 7th Baronet of Lucknow, and his ex-wife Penelope Nunan. Speaking at the time of her death, Lawrence told The Sun, ""I have absolutely no idea why this happened or what was troubling her. It is so awful. [...] I was last in contact with her a couple of weeks ago."" Isabelle's mother, Penelope, was equally distraught, telling The U.S. Sun at the time, ""This is the worst possible nightmare...my daughter is married to an American who is in the spotlight, and he is still trying to deal with it. It is a very sad event."" In a statement, Isabelle's family paid tribute to her as the ""light of our lives."" ""She was courageous and took all life’s opportunities without fear, showering love and kindness on her friends, family, and children along the way,"" they wrote. ""Her projects were as diverse as her passions, reflecting a curiosity about people and our culture that inspired everyone lucky enough to spend time with her."" ""We remember her as a soul mate, beautiful daughter, sister, devoted mother and wife."" Isabelle was born in Bath, England, in 1984 and was privately educated before graduating from Oxford University with a degree in biological sciences. After graduating, Isabelle advised former British Prime Minister David Cameron on his Tech City start-up initiative. She was also a DJ and socialite who was friends with celebrities such as singer Amy Winehouse and actress Jameela Jamil. Isabelle later moved to Los Angeles to pursue film-making, eventually producing a documentary on kindness and another about pickleball, per Deadline. She married Bradley in 2018, and they had two children, Poppy and Grace, who were born in 2020. Isabelle was also the stepmother to Bradley's two older children. The U.S. Sun has reached out to Bradley's attorneys for comment on the divorce filing.

Cops probe assault after Labour MP Mike Amesbury is filmed shouting ‘you’ll never threaten me again’ at man in street,Cops are carrying out enquiries,Sophia SleighSophia Sleigh,"15:47, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","16:01, 26 Oct 2024","News,Politics","POLICE are investigating after a Labour MP was filmed having a row with a member of the public. A video shows Mike Amesbury shouting ""you'll never threaten me again"" at a man lying on the ground in Frodsham, Cheshire. The MP for Runcorn and Helsby says: “You won’t ever threaten me again will you? “You won’t ever threaten me again.” When someone in the background points out Mr Amesbury is the local MP, he says: “Yes I am. You won’t threaten the MP ever again, will you?” Mr Amesbury said: ""Last night, I was involved in an incident that took place after I felt threatened on the street following an evening out with friends. “This morning, I contacted Cheshire Police myself to report what happened during this incident. ""I will not be making further public comment but will, of course, cooperate with any inquiries if required by Cheshire Police. “I remain fully committed to working hard for the people of Runcorn and Helsby, and am determined to remain an open and accessible MP for our community.” The Labour Party said: “We are aware of an incident that took place last night.

"Meghan Markle dumped the Royal Family, dumped her friends – & Prince Harry could be next for the CHOP, royal expert says",Watch our exclusive chat with Hugo Vickers in the video player above,"Summer Raemason, News ReporterSummer Raemason, News Reporter","13:13, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","13:13, 26 Oct 2024",Royals,"MEGHAN Markle dumped the Royal Family and her friends - and Prince Harry could be next for the chop, a royal expert has claimed. The Duchess of Sussex, 43, raised eyebrows earlier this month as she made two solo public appearances without Harry. Since getting married to Harry in 2018, Meghan has fallen out with a number of people including her family, her in-laws and her best friend Jessica Mulroney. There are also rumours of tension with tennis star Serena Williams, while Sophie Trudeau has reportedly ""distanced herself"" from Meg. It comes as royal experts have previously suggested Meghan and Harry are living ""increasingly live ""separate lives"". Now Hugo Vickers has spoken out about the future of the Duke and Duchess. The royal biographer and broadcaster revealed he is worried how Meghan's behaviour over the years was a pattern which could see Harry suffer. The 72-year-old exclusively told The Sun: ""People usually act in character, and they usually act on form. ""I hate to say it but her form is that she dumped her father, she dumped her first husband, she dumped her Canadian chef lover. ""She dumped Jessica Mulroney. She then dumped the dumped the entire British Royal family. ""So who is going to be next for the chop? I think inevitably, probably Prince Harry, and there'll come a time when she'll think that she doesn't need him."" Hugo added that although it hasn't happened yet, Harry will eventually be painted as the person ""in the wrong"". He said: ""I don't know when she might make that particular call and it's not for me to speculate, but you know she will probably somehow put him in the wrong, so that she can say that she's a wronged woman, and he's just behaved like all the others. ""I mean I don't think she ever admits that she is wrong about anything, but I feel very sorry for Prince Harry, because I think he's in a very difficult place at the moment. ""I think he has been for some time. I don't think that her projects have done Harry any good."" Hugo says that when the Duke has gone off on his own and got involved with initiatives close to his heart like the Invictus Games, he has been more successful. The royal biographer added: ""The Invictus games wasn't entirely his initiative, but he certainly was the one who made it famous and popular, and he's done an incredibly good job with it. ""What's strange about that is that the message, as far as I can read of Invictus, is, you are not a victim, you are able to get on with life, and are able to make wonderful contributions, and he gets people going again. ""And yet what has he done to himself, or what's he allowed to happen to himself? ""He's turned himself into a victim, I mean, he's always complaining about everything and how everybody's against him, and you know there's interviews; Oprah, Winfrey Netflix, the book Spare. ""It's all a litany of 'poor little me' complaints, which is terrible."" Hugo believes that if Meghan had not come along it ""wouldn't have happened"" but also concedes Harry was complicit in it. He added: ""My reading of it is, she detected that he was uncomfortable about certain things, and in a way he she exploited that and fed on it to the point that he definitely went willingly."" It comes as Tina Brown claimed in a podcast that Harry was being led like a “lamb to the slaughter” who ""follows Meghan Markle like a child"". During the chat, Tina also criticised Meghan’s judgement, and said: “She has all these people, asks them their opinion, and then doesn’t follow it”. Tina has not held back talking about the Sussexes over the years, famously describing the couple’s ""Megxit"" and leaving the royal family as a “disaster”. It comes as a source close to the couple said a “twin-track approach is evolving” in response to their alleged “professional separation”. By Jon Rogers and Summer Raemason MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry are 'going their own ways' as they increasingly live 'separate lives', royal experts told The Sun. Speaking on our first ever Royal Exclusive Live show, Arthur Edwards and Jennie Bond lifted the lid on the power couple's recent time apart. Sun legend Arthur revealed how the pair are 'doing things separately now' after failing to be spotted together in three weeks. Meanwhile Ms Bond, a royal correspondent for the last 35 years, also revealed: ""Meghan is not popular. She doesn't want to come back and they are going their own ways, to some extent"". The pair spoke on our first Royal Exclusive Live show, which you can watch on our YouTube channel. The event was hosted on Friday night in front of a live audience of more than 100 special guests. Mr Edwards said: “I don’t think she [Meghan] can come here much. “I don’t think people think too much of her. “I think she’s struggling in popularity in the UK and I think they seem to be doing things separately now. She’s got her programme and he’s got his. Mr Edwards added: “He comes into Britain now with no fuss. “He’s come for the Invictus Games, in and out with no fuss, he came for his uncle’s funeral, no fuss."" Royal commentator Jennie Bond said: “The point is he doesn’t want to come back [into the Royal Family in the UK], I think. “He regarded it as a trap. He still thinks his father and his brother are trapped and he’s finding his own way. “All credit to him. “I think Meghan has her own independent style and way of life. “Yes, it’s not in tune with the people in the UK. “She’s not popular and I don’t think she wants to come back and therefore they are going their own ways, to an extent. “But I hope and believe that Harry is very happy in his life."" Prince Harry is said to have had a “three-week break”, which included a solo trip to Lesotho in Africa in honour of his charity, Sentebale. Harry also attended a string of events in New York unaccompanied by his wife, and also did a surprise TV stint and tour of a haunted maze on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. It follows the revelations that Harry celebrated the night of his milestone 40th birthday without Meghan in September. The duke went on a hiking trip with pals to celebrate his big day, leaving his wife and their kids at home.  Sources close to the couple insist it was Meghan who organised the lads’ trip. However, a Sussex confidante addressed rumours, insisting: “It is normal for couples to not do everything together.” By Summer Raemason “MOANING” Meghan Markle has “upset everybody and lost almost all her allies including me,” a royal expert has said. Broadcaster and royal biographer Hugo Vickers, 72, has taken a swipe at the Duchess of Sussex, 43, adding that it “can’t be a coincidence” that the royal has managed to lose so many supporters. In particular, Mr Vickers singled out the former Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown as someone Meghan had upset. Ms Brown took part in an episode of The Ankler podcast where she took aim at the Duchess, saying Meghan had “the worst judgement of anyone in the entire world” and that Megxit had been “a disaster”. Mr Vickers told The Sun Online: ""Megan does seem to have a capacity for losing friends and allies all around the place and Tina Brown, of course, is a very intelligent observer of the scene, and she's been doing it for a very long time. ""For what it's worth, Meghan lost me as an ally, too, because when she first joined the Royal Family, the line I was taking was she's the first member to have addressed the United Nations. ""There was so much that she could do, but she gradually managed to upset everybody, including Tina Brown, and that can't be a coincidence.” He also explained how he had “lost confidence” in the former Suits actress with the birth of her son Archie. Mr Vickers said: ""The way I lost confidence when there was all that ridiculous nonsense about when Archie was born, and she wouldn't tell us. ""She was the first woman I've ever heard of who's given birth and subsequently gone into labour later on. ""That doesn't normally seem to happen, that seems to be rather strange, and then she wouldn't tell us who the godparents were, and all these small things, you know, are really tiresome.” Mr Vickers also revealed that while Meghan’s profile was given an enormous boost by marrying Prince Harry he thought she “wasn’t particularly committed” to being part of the Royal Family. He said: ""It does seem to me that she wasn't particularly committed to being a member of the Royal Family. ""By marrying Prince Harry, her profile went up globally, enormously, and so people wanted to hear more about her, and to some extent more from her. “There was some quite worrying things quite early on when the four of them were on the platform together and she was saying, 'we've got to hit the road running'. “In other words let's get on with me using my new role to promote what I'm interested in.” He added: ""I think she probably misunderstood quite a lot of things to be quite honest about what it meant to be a member of the Royal Family, which is a life of complete service and devotion. ""They work extremely hard, but they're working for us, not for themselves.” Mr Vickers believes that Meghan quickly realised her status was that of being Harry’s wife and she wanted to capitalise on that but it wasn’t going that well. Mr Vickers added: ""I never thought she would stay forever to be honest. “But I didn't think that she would go with Prince Harry while the Queen was alive, because actually that caused the Queen an enormous amount of distress and anxiety at the end of her life. ""I don't think she has good judgement. “I think she had a plan, and now it may take a little while longer for us to know whether her eventual plan works out for her.”"
Iran vows revenge for Israel’s ‘Day of Repentance’ blitz as Hamas warns strike is ‘escalation’ amid fears of all-out-war,Watch the IDF confirm the 'precise strikes on military targets in Iran' in the clip above,Annabel BateEllie DoughtyAnnabel BateEllie Doughty,"0:27, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","15:30, 26 Oct 2024","News,World News","IRAN has vowed to seek revenge on Israel after it launched three waves of airstrikes into the country overnight - following a series of attacks from Tehran over the past year. Dubbing it a violation of international law, Iran said it is ""entitled and obligated to defend itself against external aggressive acts"". Israel's military operation - dubbed ""Days of Repentance"" - came as the war-torn region has been bracing for an Israeli response to Iran's drone attack on October 1. Hamas - Iran's terror puppet group based in Gaza - slammed the Israeli strikes as an ""escalation"", calling it a ""violation of Iran's sovereignty"". Meanwhile Iran's most powerful proxy Hezbollah, operating out of Lebanon, said today that it launched a drone attack against Israel's Tel Nof airbase, south of Tel Aviv, in response to last night's attack. It also claimed to have targeted an intelligence base in the northern city of Safed with a rocket barrage. Israel has not verified the group's claims. Iranian military sources have said four soldiers were killed in the overnight attack with the figure ""expected to rise further"", state news agency Tasnim News reports. It also said others left wounded are in ""critical"" condition. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) announced on Saturday that their revenge blitz against Iranian military bases had finished, and warned that any response from Iran would force them to ""pay a heavy price"". IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Israel was ""conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran"" in response to ""relentless"" attacks by Iran and its proxies since October 7. He added: ""If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond. ""Our message is clear: All those who threaten the State of Israel and seek to drag the region into a wider escalation will pay a heavy price."" Iranian state TV confirmed on Saturday that several strong explosions were heard around the capital and in the more remote rural regions, beginning at around 2am local time. Two Israeli officials told The New York Times that some 20 different sites were hit in the overnight attack. The first wave of attacks focused on Iranian air defence systems, with the second and third targeting missile and drone bases and production sites, Israeli and American officials told Axios. Israel reportedly sent a message of warning to Iran on Friday ahead of the retaliatory airstrikes - warning them not to respond, Axios reports. Sources said it was an attempt to limit the possibility of a wider regional conflict after the strikes. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, speaking from Samoa, said he is monitoring the situation in the Middle East ""closely"". He urged ""restraint"" from both sides, adding: ""Iran should not respond."" ""We will continue to work with allies to de-escalate the situation across the region,"" he said. Witnesses in Tehran confirmed hearing loud explosions during the early morning blitz. ""It was so loud and the sky became red,"" said an Iranian resident in Tehran, who asked not to be named, Middle East Monitor reports. Iranian authorities revealed that at an attack on one of their police convoys in the southern region of Sistan and Baluchestan killed at least 10 officers on Saturday. Authorities identified no immediate suspects for the attack, and no group has claimed responsibility. Last night's blitz marked the first time Iran has been hit by a foreign air force since its war with Iraq in the 1980s. The White House was warned shortly before the strikes began but the US was not involved, according to reports. Israel in recent weeks had been planning a response to a ballistic-missile attack by Iran on October 1, Tehran's second direct attack on Israel in six months. The first came on April 1 - with the IDF saying ""99 per cent"" of Iran's missiles were shot down or destroyed. Tehran launched an unprecedented blitz in October - aiming at least 180 ballistic missiles into Israeli territory. It caused only minimal damage and a few injuries. Iran said the barrage was in retaliation for attacks in recent months that killed leaders of Hezbollah, Hamas and the Iranian military - including Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah leader. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately said Iran had made a big mistake. Before the October attack, Israel had landed a series of devastating blows against Hezbollah, which has been firing rockets into Israel near-daily for over a year ever since the deadly Hamas attack against Israel that sparked the war in Gaza. A few days ago secret plans showing Israel's preparation for a potential revenge strike on Iran were leaked, US officials said. The alleged documents, marked as ""top secret"", were said to contain US intelligence analysing Israel's inevitable retaliation plan against Iran. They reportedly contained satellite imagery appearing to show Israel's preparation of munitions and military drills, the New York Times reports. Other reports said the Israeli Air Force was prepping long-range ballistic and air-to-surface missiles - believed to be for a potential strike against Iran. The documents also suggest Israel was conducting covert surveillance on Iran using advanced drone technology. The Sun is not directly quoting or showing the information from the leaked documents. Israel launched a ground operation into Lebanon earlier this month to attack Hezbollah and push the terror group away from the border to allow displaced Israelis to return. This has stoked existing tensions in the region with more than 1,900 people in Lebanon killed in the five weeks since Israel invaded. Israeli authorities have said 59 people have been killed in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights. The Israeli military has issued evacuation warnings for civilians in Beirut - where many fierce strikes have been concentrated. IDF Col. Avichay Adraee said during one such warning: ""You are in the vicinity of Hezbollah facilities, which the IDF will operate against in the near future."" Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon - both Iran-backed militant groups. The IDF have been striking parts of northern Gaza, claiming they are aiming to wipe out Hamas brutes. But the strikes have also killed scores of Palestinians who have been unable to flee the densely populated area. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war so far, according to Gaza-run health centres.  The figure also includes Hamas terrorists, but Israel has not specified the exact ratio of civilian to militant. Hamas killed around 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals in the October 7 attack last year, and kidnapped around 250 more into Gaza."
Reason Andy Carroll’s estranged wife Billi Mucklow split from ace revealed as he’s seen at Halloween party with new love,A source revealed how Andy Carroll getting together with make-up artist Lou Teasdale was 'the last straw',"Paul Sims, Senior News Reporter","20:00, 26 Oct 2024","20:14, 26 Oct 2024","Showbiz,Celebrity","TOWIE star Billi Mucklow fears footballer Andy Carroll was cheating on her before they split. Pals say she suspects the ex-Newcastle and Liverpool striker was seeing celeb make-up artist Lou Teasdale before they announced their separation last month. Carroll, 35, was photographed kissing and cuddling Lou, 41, on a recent holiday in Majorca, and also at a London bar. But sources say mum-of-three Billi, 36, is aware of contact between the pair “long before then”. And Billi, who has remained in the couple’s £5million Essex home, is now preparing for a divorce action. A source said: “Billi contacted a lawyer after she found out he and Lou were seeing each other during the summer. “There is still a lot to sort out and she’s discussing her options. “They were together for 11 years. “Him getting together with Lou was the last straw. “She can’t be sure about when, but her friends and family are extremely angry. “They feel Andy has treated her appallingly.” Carroll, now with French club Bordeaux, announced his split from Billi after two years of marriage in a statement to The Sun on Sunday at the end of last month. He said: “It has been a hard few months for our family and we continue to move forward amicably for our children.” He and Lou were snapped days later smooching on a Spanish beach. Andy and influencer Billi got engaged in 2014. They wed in 2022 — but only after a row when he was pictured sozzled in bed with two women on his Dubai stag do. One later insisted he was a gent and that nothing sexual had happened. As well as three kids with Billi, Carroll also has two children, aged 15 and 14, from a previous relationship. The Sun on Sunday approached Carroll for comment."
"Docs told me exact chance I’d die. I wasn’t scared until they said what I had to do to stay alive, says Jeremy Clarkson","I always knew this lifestyle wasn’t going to cause me to live to 112, and I didn’t really care, says Clarkson",Jeremy ClarksonJeremy Clarkson,"21:10, 25 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","13:30, 26 Oct 2024","News,Opinion","LAST week, doctors announced that the arteries feeding my heart were like something you’d find hanging from the roof of a cave in the Peak ­District and that I needed extremely urgent surgery. You might imagine this was all very scary but honestly, it wasn’t. The doctors were skilled professionals and they had all the tools they’d need, so during the procedure I was so relaxed that at one point, I nodded off. I felt like a car. My fuel lines had become all clogged up and they were mending them. Easy. Sure, they said there was a five per cent chance that my heart would stop but there’s a five per cent chance I’ll be eaten by a lion this afternoon and I’m not worried about that. What is scary though is what came ­afterwards. The advice on how I must live my life from now on. Literally, I am not allowed to have fun any more. I must live in a ­Liberal ­Democrat, holier-than-thou fog of weeds, seeds and yoga. This is terrifying. And if I go to a party, I must stand in a corner, nursing some refreshing elderflower juice, before going home at about 9.30. That’s ­terrifying too. Then there’s my work, which I love. I like it so much in fact, I currently have ten jobs. I honestly make Elon Musk look like a slacker. I write three newspaper columns a week, I have a brewery, a pub, a shop, I host Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?, run a farm, make a television show about that and this week, my latest book came out. “Yes well, a lot of that will have to go” said the doctor. “And what would I replace it with? “Golf’s good”, he ­suggested. No, it isn’t. What do people do when they stop work? It wouldn’t be so bad if I had a hobby but I’ve always thought that hobbies are for people who were caught playing with themselves by their mothers when they were younger. “Stop doing that and get a hobby.” Have you ever tried kale? Well, don’t, because it’s like eating the contents of a AAA battery I wasn’t, and that’s why I don’t make Airfix models or play the piano. Which means that if I didn’t work, I’d just sit at home all day, rotting. The worst problem though is diet. To cut my alarmingly high levels of cholesterol, I need to cut out, completely, ­everything I like eating. Bacon, sausages, beef, lamb, pork, butter, chips, proper milk, Cadbury’s fruit and nut bars and the interesting bit in an egg. I’ve had a week now to live in the new regime and it’s horrific. Have you ever tried kale? Well, don’t, because it’s like eating the contents of a AAA battery. And then there’s Greek yoghurt. What’s that all about? I’ve suspected for some time that yoghurt is made from the cheese found in a homeless person’s ­genitals, and now I know this is so. It’s disgusting. But it’s not as bad as almond milk. Which a) isn’t milk and b) tastes like ­liquefied marzipan. Which is the only foodstuff worse than Greek yoghurt. Booze? Technically, this isn’t necessarily high in cholesterol, but it does make you fat so that has to go too. All of it. So, I own a brewery and pub and at the shop, a butcher’s counter. Yum yum. Except now, I can no longer get high on my own supply. Instead I have to buy my “food” from some kind of wholefood store that sells nothing but South African nuclear-free peace beans. We must now move on to the question of exercise. I’ve always seen this is something you do when travelling from the car to the pub, or from the lunch table to the sitting room. But apparently, when I’ve rec­overed from the operation, I must do more. I must even go on the sort of “walk” where I end up back where I started. What’s the point of that? And I must pick things up with the sole aim of putting them down again. I’m also encouraged to sit up, using nothing but my stomach muscles. And why? So I can lie down then repeat the process, over and over again until I’m exhausted. Of course, you may well argue that I had it coming, that the wonkiness of my arteries is all my fault and that I shouldn’t moan. And you do have a point. The problem is that I see the gift of life as being about the same as the gift of, let’s say, a million pounds. Some people would invest this money and live carefully and parsimoniously on the interest. I wouldn’t, and indeed I didn’t. I ­grabbed the gift by the scruff of its neck and went berserk. I wanted to see every country in the world, and have a Ferrari and always be the last to leave a party and never say no to anything that sounded exciting. Not many people have dropped a laser-guided bomb from an F-15 fighter bomber. But I have. I lived in a blizzard of hangovers and jet lag for 30 years. Smoking? Yup. Started at 14 and became a world champion, sucking down sixty Marlboro Reds a day. Drink? Big time. When doctors asked how much I was putting away each day, I’d tell them straight. “Three or four pints.” They’d be reasonably happy with that, till I added: “Of wine.” I always knew this lifestyle wasn’t going to cause me to live to 112, and I didn’t really care. Because why deny yourself all that fun in your thirties and forties and even ­fifties just so you can have as long as possible with a grey face and a tube up your nose in an old people’s home? Here’s the thing, though. I’m now 64 and last week, when the Grim Reaper poked his nose round the door, I decided that actually, I quite fancied living a little bit longer. I want to see my grandchildren grow up. I saw the dawn this morning and it was magnificent, so I’d quite like to see a few more of those too. Also, I still want to visit the Galapagos Islands. To achieve all this, I must live on water and steamed fish, and exercise. But it’s going to be my eleventh job. Not dying. Of course, there will be those who say I should have started on this new career path earlier. They have a point, except for one thing. If you want to avoid spending the last few years of your life in a festival of boredom and denial, you must start the festival when you’re about 32. And I can’t see the point of that. Living a long life of misery to avoid a short bit of misery at the end. My recommendation then is to keep your foot hard down until you run out of fuel. And that’s when you buy the Tesla Lib Dem lifestyle.  When you no longer have a choice. In short, je ne regrette rien. SIGNS you may have heart disease can come in many different forms - and some might seem unusual. These are the signs to look out for:"
Strictly mystery as scandal-hit Wynne Evans and Katya Jones disappear from screens again,Eagle-eyed fans at home noticed how the pair were missing from the iconic 'Clauditorium',"Alex Doyle, TV ReporterAlex Doyle, TV Reporter","19:47, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","20:01, 26 Oct 2024","TV,News TV","WYNNE Evans and Katya Jones disappeared from screens during Strictly's Halloween special. The latest episode of the BBC series saw the pro dancers and their celeb partners dress up for the spooky occasion. At the start of the show hosts Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman introduced the couples as well as the judges. Wynne, 52, could be seen dressed as the devil with pro Katya also donning a matching outfit. However, the pair then disappeared for over 30 minutes, failing to appear on the raised platform with Claudia Winkleman and their fellow contestants. Eagle-eyed fans noticed at home, with one writing on social media: ""Where's Katya and Wyn?"" A second wrote: ""Is Wynne not allowed to be with Claudia and the other contestants at the top of the stairs? Have not seen him there all show."" ""Are they deliberately keeping Wynne & Katya away from the cameras,"" asked a third. Wynne and Katya did eventually appear for their Salsa, earning a total of 31 points, before vanishing once again. The BBC insisted Wynne was in the 'Clauditorium' when contacted by The Sun, despite fans not seeing him. At around 7:40pm they both then appeared in the back of a shot as Shayne Ward and Nancy Xu spoke to Claudia. It comes after the the Go Compare star also disappeared for a period last week. Earlier this month he was left 'devastated' after being embroiled in a 'TV grope' scandal. He could be seen with his hand around professional partner Katya Jones' waist during a live show. He later said it was ""a stupid joke that had gone wrong"". Wynne later said on BBC Radio: ""I'm absolutely heartbroken by the things that have been written about me in the last day. ""It's not nice to live in that time, but basically Katya and I are really, really close and we're really good friends, and on Saturday night we made a stupid joke. ""It was a stupid joke that went wrong, OK?  ""We thought it was funny. It wasn't funny. ""It was been totally misinterpreted."""
Keir Starmer denies he’s a ‘liar’ & promises ‘light at end of the tunnel’ as Brits brace for £35billion Budget tax bomb,Sir Keir has said the pain will be worth it,Ryan Sabey in SamoaRyan MerrifieldRyan Sabey in SamoaRyan Merrifield,"10:42, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","10:42, 26 Oct 2024",Politics,"SIR Keir Starmer denied lying to Brits over plans to hike their taxes - as he promised them “light at the end of the tunnel”. Labour are expected to drop a £35 billion tax bomb on the UK in their Budget on Wednesday. It includes a hugely controversial tax hike on employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs) by up to 2 per cent. The move will cost firms up to £20 billion. Speaking at a press conference in Samoa this morning, the PM insisted the pain would be worth it to fix Britain’s broken public services. He said: ""What I want to be judged on, one, have we made people better off? ""Do they feel better off under a Labour government because we fix the foundations. ""Secondly, that we genuinely pick the NHS up, put it back on its feet, but also at the same time reimagine it and make it fit for the future. ""That is as much about reform and technology as it is about money. There is no investment without reform as far as I'm concerned."" Labour promised not to raise taxes on “working people” - including NICs, income tax and VAT. But they have been accused of lying to Brits as Budget leaks suggest employer NICs will go up, while income tax thresholds will be frozen - forcing people to pay more tax on their wages. Sir Keir was accused by ex-Tory Chancellor Lord Norman Lamont of stoking ""class war"". It came after he said that ""working people"" do not make money from renting property or owning stocks and shares. Asked directly if he “misled” Brits with his tax pledge, the PM said: “No."" He continued: “We were very clear about the tax rises that we would necessarily have to make up, whatever the circumstances and you've listed them there and I listed them, I don't know how many times in the campaign. “We were really clear in the manifesto about and in the campaign that we wouldn't be increasing taxes on working people and spelt out what we meant by that in terms of income tax, in terms of NICs and in terms of VAT, and we intend to keep the promises that we made in our manifesto.” THE Budget is big news and where you'll often hear announcements about taxes. But what exactly is it? The Budget is when the Government outlines its plans for the economy including taxation and spending. The Chancellor of the Exchequer delivers a speech in the House of Commons and announces plans for things like tax hikes, cuts and changes to Universal Credit and the minimum wage. At the same time, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) publishes an independent analysis of the UK economy. Usually, the Budget is a once-a-year event and usually takes place in the Autumn, with a smaller update known as the Spring Statement. But there have been exceptions in recent years when there have been more updates, or the announcements have taken place at different times, for example during the pandemic or when there is a General Election. On the day of the Budget, usually a Wednesday, the Chancellor is photographed outside No 11 Downing Street with the red box. She then heads to the House of Commons to deliver her speech, at around 12.30 following Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs). Changes announced in the Budget are sometimes implemented the same day, while others may not have a set date. For example, a change to tobacco duty usually happens on the same day, pushing up the price of cigarettes. Some tax changes are set to come in at the start of a new tax year, which is April 6. Other changes may need to pass through Parliament before coming into law. Asked for his definition of “working people”, Sir Keir previously told Sky it was someone who “goes out and earns their living, usually paid in a sort of monthly cheque” but cannot “write a cheque to get out of difficulties”. Pressed if this included people with assets, said: “Well, they wouldn't come within my definition.” Tory shadow minister Claire Coutinho blasted: “Keir Starmer went into an election saying he’d protect working people only to define that as a subset of people with jobs once he won. “Labour either had no plan for post election or straight up lied to the public on multiple fronts.” The warning came as Rachel Reeves sparked fears of mortgage rate pain after ripping up her debt rules. The Chancellor confirmed plans to change the way national debt is calculated to hand herself up to £50billion more to play with at next week’s Budget. It will let her embark on a massive borrowing spree to fund key manifesto pledges while still claiming to have met her promise to have debt falling in five years’ time.  But the financial fiddling risks spooking the markets in a Liz Truss-style panic, with government borrowing costs sent soaring yesterday as a result. Shadow Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the move could force interest rates to remain high for longer and wreak more misery on homeowners remortgaging."

Every year the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) takes nominations from across the country for its Champion Beer of Britain award. This competition is one of the most coveted and well-respected competitions in the world and can put the winner firmly in the national and international spotlight. All beers must be nominated by individual CAMRA members and a tasting panel. They then compete in regional competitions using a strict blind tasting policy. There are seven judging categories: The shortlist has been whittled down and one winner was crowned at a ceremony in Newark on Wednesday. Crouch Vale’s Amarillo was named the overall winner after a hard-fought final round of judging. It has an ABV of 5% and is made with American hops. The beer was described by Christine Cryne, the judging panel organiser, as having “a tangy aroma with a faint note of biscuit”. She added: “The flavour is full of tropical and citrus notes on a sweet biscuit base. Dry sweetish bitter finish. A full flavoured beer.” Christine described it as a “commendable winner, worthy of the respected title despite exceptionally strong competition”. Brewery directors Colin and Fiona Bocking said they were “delighted” to have bagged the award after previously winning it in 2005 and 2006. The beer can be bought through the brewery’s website or at a selection of pubs and farm shops across the UK. Eight 500ml bottles are available for £20.26 on the Crouch Vale website. Silver prize winner was the IPA from Anspach and Hobday, which has a 6% ABV. Judges said it is a “wonderful fruity new world IPA”.   It has aromas of citrus and tropical fruit which are “perfectly balanced by the bitterness, leading to a dry, spicy finish.” It can be bought online through the brewery’s website. In bronze was the Trawlerboys Best Bitter from Green Jack Brewery, which has an ABV of 4.6%. It was described by judges as being an “attractive orangey brown beer with a honey biscuit nose”. Judges said it is “complex and very drinkable”.  It is available on the Green Jack website. Laura Emson, CAMRA’s Awards Director, said: “Crouch Vale should be incredibly proud of this accolade, and I hope that beer lovers across the UK will seek out and try Amarillo out for themselves.” Here is the full list of all category winners: MILD Gold – Penzance Brewing Co, Mild Silver – Brains, Dark Bronze – Five Kingdoms Brewery, McGregor’s Mild SESSION BITTER Gold – Logan Beck Brewing, Proper Bitter Silver – Mighty Oak Brewing Co, Captain Bob Bronze – Windsor & Eton Brewery, Guardsman PREMIUM BITTER Gold – Green Jack Brewery, Trawlerboys Best Bitter Silver – Sharp’s Brewery, Sea Fury Bronze – Cairngorm Brewery, Wildcat IPAs Gold – Anspach & Hobday, The IPA Silver – Byatt’s Brewery, Mahana IPA Bronze – Bragdy Twt Lol, Dreigiau’r Diafol / Diablo Dragons SESSION PALE, BLOND & GOLDEN ALES Gold – Loch Lomond Brewery, Southern Summit Silver – Oakham Ales, Citra Bronze – Bewdley Brewery, Sunshine PREMIUM PALE, BLOND & GOLDEN ALES Gold – Crouch Vale Brewery, Amarillo Silver – St Austell Brewery, Proper Job Bronze – Swannay Brewery, Orkney IPA WINTER ROUND WINNERS Stouts and Porters, Session: Lancaster Brewery, Lancaster Black Stouts and Porters, Strong: Green Jack Brewery, Baltic Trader Export Stout Speciality, Flavoured: Purple Moose Brewery, Elderflower Ale (Cwrw Ysagwen) Barley Wines and Strong Old Ales: Sarah Hughes Brewery, Snowflake Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?

"Hero neighbour describes smashing window to save boy, 2, as mum screamed ‘my baby’ after horror triple stabbing",A man in his 40s has been arrested,Joe HaddenMorgan JohnsonJoe HaddenMorgan Johnson,"14:51, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","15:59, 26 Oct 2024","News,UK News","A HERO neighbour smashed a window to save a boy after he was stabbed alongside a ""blood-soaked"" mum and daughter. The two-year-old tot was terrifyingly knifed in the frenzied attack in East London on Friday evening. A woman in her 30s and an eight-year-old girl were also seriously injured in the horror on residential street First Avenue in Dagenham. A hero neighbour has now described the moment he burst inside a house to save the boy. Davey Holland, 40, forced entry into the property after getting a knock at the door by the blood-soaked mother. The dad-of-six told The Sun: “The mum knocked at my door. It was horrible. “She was saying there’s a baby in the house, please help him.” Davey smashed open a window - passing by the suspect who was being treated by an off-duty police officer. A man, in his 40s, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. The three victims, who are believed to be known to each other, were attacked at around 5.35pm. They were rushed to a major trauma centre to receive urgent treatment for stab injuries. Police had previously said the injuries of the woman, in her 30s, and the boy were life threatening. And that both the injured children were girls. The arrested man - detained at the scene - was transported to hospital after being ""taken unwell"". He has now been discharged into police custody. Mick Aransibia, 63, a builder who lives on the street, told The Sun: ""I came out and the whole street was lit up with blue lights. ""There was a good 12 units here in just police alone."" Another witness told us: ""About 5.30pm I heard shouting - I looked out of the window and I saw a lady covered in blood. ""She was very distraught, she was with a little girl. ""It’s shocking - it’s not something that happens in this area. ""Kids literally play outside in the street, that’s how safe it is. I look at it as a personal tragedy - but it’s so sad.” Another person said: ""My little nephew was playing out and he ran in saying he could see blood everywhere. ""When I came out, there was a woman running down the street with a girl. ""It didn’t seem real - I just phoned the ambulance straight away. I feel like I’m still in shock."" One witness explained that his young nephew was playing on the road when the attack took place, prompting him to find the injured victims and call an ambulance. He told The Sun: ""My nephew was playing outside and he came running in the house saying “someone’s bleeding, someone’s bleeding."" Referring to the man arrested, he added: ""He came out of the house and locked the door so no one could get in.. The police arrived pretty quickly, and he was arrested outside."" Aerial images showed a huge emergency services response, including more than eight police cars and an air ambulance. A crime scene remained in place last night, the Met said. Enquiries into the circumstances continue, the force added. Detective Superintendent Lewis Basford, responsible for policing in Barking and Dagenham, said: ""This is a truly shocking attack and I want to thank local residents for their assistance and patience while we deal with this incident. ""At this early stage, we believe those involved were known to each other and we are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident. ""A crime scene will remain in place for some time while our officers carry out vital work and you will see an increased policing presence in the area over the coming days. ""If you have any concerns or information that could assist police then please speak to an officer or call police on 101."" A London Ambulance Service spokesperson said: ""We were called at 5.35pm today (Friday 25 October) to reports of an incident in First Avenue, Dagenham. ""We sent a number of resources to the scene including four ambulance crews, medics in fast response cars and advanced paramedics. ""We also dispatched London's Air Ambulance. We treated four people at the scene. ""We took one person to hospital and three to a major trauma centre as a priority.""

My mobile hairdresser has signalled she’d like to offer more than a head massage,READ Dear Deidre Editor Sally Land's personal replies to today's problems.,Sally LandThe Sun's Agony Aunt,"17:45, 25 Oct 2024","21:46, 25 Oct 2024",Dear Deidre,"DEAR DEIDRE: MY mobile hairdresser has made it very clear she would like to offer me more than a head massage and I’m so tempted to have an affair with her. I’m 40 and my wife is 42. We’ve been married for 13 years and have a son, seven. Our hairdresser is very attractive and in her early 30s. I do love my wife, and we get on brilliantly - except in the bedroom. She shut up shop sexually after our son was born. For a while, she’d go along with sex just to make me happy. But I could tell she didn’t enjoy it, and that was a turnoff.  Eventually, I stopped asking. I felt too rejected and unattractive. But I’m still a young man and I am extremely frustrated and miserable. I don’t want to be celibate. This hairdresser started flirting with me whenever we were alone. Originally we’d all have our haircut on the same evening, but then my wife’s hours changed so now she cuts my hair in the day and my wife and son’s in the evening. From them on her head massages definitely became more attentive and I admitted they were the best thing I’d felt in a long time. Quick as a flash she said ‘what a shame, and a waste’. She went on to tell me I was a good looking man and that she wasn’t only good at cutting hair. Since then, I’ve fantasised about sex with her and am on the brink of messaging to ask if she wants to meet. Would it be so wrong to do this, when my wife has made it clear she doesn’t desire me? DEIDRE SAYS: Having an affair is never the answer, especially if you still love your wife. You’d feel guilty, might get caught, and it wouldn’t solve the issues in your marriage. Of course it’s flattering but you’d be wise to start visiting a barbers to avoid temptation. Instead, talk to your wife and tell her why intimacy is so important to you and how much you’re missing as a couple. Ask her if she will have couples counselling with you. My support pack on Counselling tells you more about this. The College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists (cosrt.org.uk) can put you in touch with reputable counsellors. My support pack, Reviving a Woman’s Sex Drive, might also be helpful. Every problem gets a personal reply from one of our trained counsellors.

‘Definitely an upgrade’ rave fans of £800 refurbished Simba mattress slashed to £519,*If you click on a link in this story we may earn affiliate revenue.,"Lucy Atkins, Sun Selects Freelance Writer","15:01, 25 Oct 2024","15:01, 25 Oct 2024","Shopping,Home and Garden","BUYING a quality mattress is one of life's luxuries we could all do with. Sadly it is a rather costly investment, which makes this deal we have spotted on a refurbished Simba Hybrid Original Mattress well worth checking out. Simba Hybrid Original Mattress Refurbished (small double), £519 (was £799) You might not be aware (I wasn't until very recently), but the award-winning sleep brand has a whole section of refurbished mattresses on its website, selling far cheaper than the main range. For instance, the Simba Hybrid Original Mattress normally retails at £799 for a small double, but pick it up refurbished and it costs just £519 – a saving of £280. As Simba's OG mattress, it's a customer favourite with over half a million sold. The five-layer design features Simbatex foam plus 1,900 of Simba's Aerocoil micro springs for full body support and pressure relief. And if you're worried about the condition – don't be. Simba refurbished mattresses are fully tested and examined in detail and components are completely replaced if they fail the inspection. Mattresses are either ""deep cleaned or sanitised to hospital standards"", with Simba promising each one is sold ""pristine and squeaky clean."" We have tested the Hybrid Original mattress and our writer Clara Wolsey raved she ""had the best night's sleep I've had in years"" after just a few weeks of trying it. Other shoppers are impressed too, with one sharing online: 'It's got a soft top layer and firm layer below. ""Definitely an upgrade from a spring mattress."" Another five-star reviewer says: ""It's super comfortable and I look forward to sleeping now. ""Aches and pains in my back have gone and the stability has definitely improved the quality of sleep I get. My partner loves it too."" Simba Refurbished range Other refurbished mattresses include the Hybrid Pro Mattress which costs £579 for a double instead of £1,149. It's marketed as a step-up from the Hybrid Original, with 'double spring layers for more tailored support.' One of our Sun Shopping team put it to the test, and in her Simba Hybrid Pro Mattress review said, a year on ""It remains my favourite mattress that I've tested."" The Simba Hybrid Luxe Mattress can also be found refurbished and this is our tester's honest verdict. Two words: bargain city. Shopping Simba's refurbished range is like scoring a luxury mattress with a VIP discount. You get the same dreamy comfort and high-quality sleep experience – but at a fraction of the price. These mattresses are carefully checked, cleaned and refurbished, so it's like they’ve just had a mini spa day. Buying a refurbished model is also eco-friendly as you'll be helping to reduce waste and give these mattresses a second life. If you love a bargain and a good night’s sleep (who doesn’t?), the Simba refurbished range is a no-brainer for comfort, savings and a little environmental good karma. The difference between a new Simba mattress and a refurbished one is kind of like the difference between a shiny, fresh-from-the-dealer car versus a well-maintained, pre-loved ride. A new Simba mattress comes straight from the factory, is completely brand new and ready to give you that 'new mattress smell.' A refurbished Simba mattress, on the other hand, has been returned (often after a short trial period), inspected, cleaned and spruced up. Think of it as a mattress that’s been on a little adventure but is still in excellent shape. Both give you Simba's signature comfort, but the refurbished one comes at a wallet-friendly price. So, if you want to save money and don’t mind a mattress that’s had a quick reboot, shopping refurbished could be the perfect answer. If only brand new and top-of-the-range will do for you, our Simba Earth APEX Mattress review might tempt you to splash out. Or if you're looking to improve the comfort of your existing mattress, check out our tried and tested roundup of the best mattress toppers. Yes, it’s totally safe to buy a refurbished mattress, especially from trusted brands like Simba. For peace of mind, shoppers are advised to read exactly how Simba refurbish their mattresses on the website.

This ensures each one is in top-notch shape before it’s back on the market.  Simba even offers warranties, so you’ve got peace of mind that your refurbished mattress is as good as new. If you're a fan of bargains and eco-friendly choices, a refurbished mattress is a safe and very savvy way to catch those Z's. Want to find more savings on your online shopping?

Brentford 4 Ipswich 3: Bryan Mbeumo breaks Tractor Boys’ hearts with 96th-minute winner,"Tractor Boys man had absolute nightmare day with his own goal, conceding penalty and red card","Dan King, Sports News ColumnistDan King, Sports News Columnist","17:07, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","17:31, 26 Oct 2024","Sport,Football,Premier League","BRYAN MBEUMO broke Ipswich’s hearts with a lucky late winner in a sensational game. Just when it seemed substitute Liam Delap had nicked a point for the ten-man Tractor Boys with a late equaliser, Mbeumo struck in the sixth of seven minutes of stoppage time. The Bees’ forward was probably trying to cross the ball but instead it bounced in front of visiting goalkeeper Arjanet Muric and nestled in the net. Even then there was time for Delap to hit the post. But after an afternoon in which they experienced every possible emotion, Ipswich and their fans found themselves heading back to Suffolk defeated again. What could and maybe should have been a dream day for Ipswich and Harry Clarke ultimately turned into a nightmare. A first win of the season seemed within reach when they led 2-0 with barely a minute of the first half left. But Yoane Wissa pulled one back and then Clarke was the victim of a triple whammy. First the Ipswich full-back, making his first Premier League start, was credited with an own goal for the home team’s equaliser before the first half ended. Then he gave away the VAR-assisted penalty from which Mbeumo put Brentford ahead just after the break. FOOTBALL FREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS Clarke’s personal misery was complete when he was sent off for a second yellow card which replays suggested was harsh. Yet the drama was not over. Delap turned in a Leif Davis cross to send the away fans back into delirium after a game that gave them every possible human emotion. But after Nathan Collins had missed a great chance to make it 4-3, Mbeumo snatched his second and all three points. For most of the first half, you would never have predicted a six-goal thriller After what was surely one of the worst half hours or so of Premier League football this season, Ipswich suddenly found themselves in dreamland. It started with a bit of good fortune when Kalvin Phillps’ pass came off George Hirst’s heel but rebounded off Brentford centre-back Collins into his path. But Hirst’s lay-off to Sammie Szmodics was perfect, as was the Republic of Ireland international’s finish. The second goal arrived within three minutes, again with a stroke of good luck. Not for Ipswich winger Chiedozie Ogbene who went down in agony during the build-up and would later be taken off on a stretcher. But Ogbene’s discomfort distracted Ethan Pinnock. As the ball fell for Conor Chaplin and he found Hirst with a fine pass, Pinnock was out of position. The Ipswich striker took full advantage, clipping a lovely finish over and across Mark Flekken. Incredibly, it should soon have been three. Szmodics robbed Christian Norgaard as Brentford tried to play out but Flekken made a good save to keep out the shot. Davis then fired wide before earning a yellow card for timewasting from a throw with 50 minutes of the game to go. And Brentford showed how long that was by scoring twice in quick succession before the break. Keane Lewis-Potter made a brilliant burst off the left flank and played in Vitaly Janelt, who squared it for Wissa to make it 1-2. In the first of six minutes of stoppage-time, the Bees produced by far the best move of the match. The ball went from back to front quickly and smoothly. Mikkel Damsgaard played the final pass in behind the away defence and there was Wissa again. His shot beat Muric and a sliding Clarke could only help the ball into the net. A VAR check confirmed Wissa had timed his run to perfection. Clarke and Ispwich’s day went from bad to worse within four minutes of the restart. Lewis-Potter got on the wrong side of him and although Clarke started to pull the Brentford winger outside the box, he kept on doing it inside. Referee Lewis Smith initially awarded a free kick and a yellow card. But VAR upgraded it to a penalty and Mbeumo scored with Ivan Toney-style confidence from the spot. Ipswich were now all over the shop. Philips had to tidy up after a Jens Cajuste back pass let Damsgaard in and Lewis-Potter had a shot blocked before his cross was headed off target by Norgaard. Wissa had a great chance but Muric saved, and the Ipswich ‘keeper did even better to keep out a Damsgaard shot. How crucial those stops seemed when Delap grabbed an unlikely equaliser with less than five minutes to go.  Brentford defender Collins should have swung the pendulum again in the third of seven minutes of stoppage time only to fire the ball wastefully over the bar. But the Bees and Mbeumo provided the sting in the tail."

"Premier League LIVE SCORES: Everton DRAW with Fulham after Beto’s last-gasp finish, Haaland scores in City win",,"Craig Mahood, Betting & Gaming Writer",,"19:36, 26 Oct 2024","Sport,Football,Premier League","PREMIER LEAGUE action returned for another blockbuster Saturday filled with late drama. Man City are back at the top of the table after an early Erling Haaland goal downed a spirited Southampton. In the game of the day, Ipswich Town went 2-0 up before Brentford fought back to 3-2 - only for the Tractor Boys to score a late equaliser. But then a howler from Arijanet Muric allowed Bryan Mbuemo to score a late Bees winner. Elsewhere, Bournemouth also scored a late equaliser at Aston Villa and Wolves drew 2-2 with Brighton having been two goals down with five minutes to play. In Saturday's late kick-off, Everton drew 1-1 with Fulham after Beto's last-gasp finish. FOOTBALL FREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS KEEP up with all the scores and the results from the Premier League with our live blog below... Erling Haaland supporters around the globe were gearing up for a big afternoon for the big man earlier. And when he scored after five minutes, it looked like it was going to be a record breaking afternoon. He had seven more attempts at goal - all from relatively close range - including FOUR inside the six-yard box yet didn't manage to add to his tally. Human after all.... Sixteen goals in five games means Match of the Day should be a good one. It was probably to be expected with Man City at home to Southampton. But that turned out to be the boring game of the day with every other game having match-changing, stoppage time goals.  Sean Dyche breathed a big sigh of relief and rightly so after Beto’s equaliser deep into time added on. But the pressure will only mount on him again despite a fifth successive game unbeaten for his Everton players delivered the kind of dreadful performance that can get managers the sack. Leaving the pitch in tears, you know how much that moment meant for Beto. On that, he told Sky Sports: “It means TOO much for me. I work hard, even when I don’t play I work hard and keep my head up every day, I try and improve to be better and help the team. “It’s emotional. These last few weeks have been difficult for me but I’m happy I scored a goal.” It was two points dropped for Fulham, but the point they did earn has taken them into the top 10. Their goal difference is zero, showing they're going to be one of those sides that don't win comfortably but also don't get thumped either. Everton move up to 15th with that goal. Beto after snatching a point for his side. Beto celebrates as the full time whistle goes following one final chance for Fulham. You just knew something was going to happen, it's been one of they  days. Beto now in floods of tears as he claps the fans and heads off. It must be a build-up of frustration watching what's being played ahead of him! He'll be thrilled with that. Fulham will be spewing. Stoppage time drama, what did I tell you! They've been mince all night but Everton look to have snatched a late, late point! Ndiaye's cross is deep but Young creeps in at the back post and volleys the ball back across goal. That finds BETO six yards out and his header on goal is deflected off Diop and creeps under Leno and into the net. Football, eh. An incredible amount of stoppage time drama already today in the Premier League. More here? There's every chance as SIX MINUTES is signaled by the fourth official. Michael Keane wins the flick on and Beto wins a corner, doing that 'waving hands up' to the crowd to get them going. Lindstrom heads over to take it. They've created zilch from open play, they have to take the set piece opportunities when they come. They cannot hit the first man. Lindstrom hits the first man. Not even 30 seconds after that double change and Dwight McNeil goes down holding his knee off the ball. When it rains, etc etc etc. He's subbed off and Jarrad Branthwaite makes a welcome return to the side. Michael Keane moves up front..... Boos for Sean Dyche as he makes a double change which involves taking Doucoure and Calvert-Lewin off. I messaged my colleague and good friend Jamie - a big Everton fan - asking him his thoughts on the game so I could relay that here. No surprises to learn he's ignoring the request. 15 minutes to go and this just about sums up the game as Fulham dominate every single stat. Except corners, so Everton do that have to cheer if nothing else.  James Tarkowski has toiled tonight and he was just absolutely ripped apart by Reiss Nelson there. Moments later it's a coming together with Diop that sees him concede a foul on halfway and pick up a booking. Not a great few minutes for him. The Cult's lead singer Ian Astbury - inside Goodison this evening - will wish his de rigeur rock singer dark glasses had protected him from witnessing ex-Toffee Alex Iwobi slotting against the club he loves. Yikes, the mood in Goodison is UGLY. Boos and jeers ringing out constantly at the minute as Fulham are making this a men vs boys outing at the minute. Fulham have taken the lead in their last two games and lost both, so there's plenty of time yet everyone! A goal scored by ex-Toffees man ALEX IWOBI but created by Emile Smith Rowe. ESR picks the ball up inside his own half and skips by three pretty pathetic attempts at a challenge, including Ashley Young who tries to trip him and can't. It's laid to Iwobi on the edge of the box who takes a couple of touches to get the ball out his feet as Tarkowski and Keane continue the mannequin act with their arms behind their backs. He looks like opening his body for the far corner but closes his foot at the last minute, curling a terrific finish into the near post beyond Pickford. He opts not to wheel away in celebration in respect to his former employers, but there's a huge smile on his face before sticking out his tongue. Rare moment of quality here.  This was the 'ball out of play' call which ruled out John McGinn's call. Definitive? Unai Emery wasn't looking for excuses after the game, saying: ""VAR is clear, of course. If VAR is telling us no goal it's clear. For me the referee was fantastic today. It was not a goal because it was out, through VAR."" Wee half chance for Raul Jimenez who is picked out with a long ball through the heart of Everton's defence. His touch just bounces through to Pickford with no defender round him really. Nearly again but not quite. The second half is underway and it can only get better which is good. Is it any surprise DCL found himself in an offside position? He's been called offside more than any other player in the Premier League. Not just that, he's absolutely MILES clear at the top of the charts! The Calvert-Lewin offside a funny one. From one angle he's definitely onside, yet from this one he's clearly off. Who'd be a VAR? Gary O'Neil knows that Wolves' late show at Brighton might well have kept him in a job. He told Sky Sports: ""At 85 minutes when Brighton scored their second goal I thought I was going to be stood here answering some more tough questions. ""The players have given an awful lot and if they keep doing that it cannot continue to go against you."" The referee gives us all a break by bringing that half to a close. Bar a really good strike from Idrissa Gueye, there was an almighty lack of quality in that one. Think this game is bad? I've just had a kebab brought to me and it has no salad or sauce on it. What's the point? Alex Iwobi skies a great chance for Fulham which just about sums up the last 45 minutes. "
Gary Lineker has ‘ready-made replacement’ already working for BBC if Match of the Day legend decides to quit,Former Match of the Day pundit Mark Lawrenson also revealed it 'feels like someone has chopped your arm off' when you leave the show,"Dylan Terry, Digital Sports JournalistDylan Terry, Digital Sports Journalist","15:44, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","15:44, 26 Oct 2024","Sport,Football","GARY LINEKER has a ""ready-made replacement"" working at the BBC should he decide to leave Match of the Day. The former England striker, 63, has presented the flagship football show since 1999 when he succeeded Des Lynman. His contract comes to an end in the summer and it remains to be seen whether he will extend his stay as the frontman for the programme. But Liverpool legend Mark Lawrenson, 67, feels the BBC already have a clear No1 candidate to step into Lineker's shoes should he depart at the end of the season. Lawrenson spent many years as a Match of the Day pundit alongside Lineker and fellow Reds icon Alan Hansen. And he believes Mark Chapman, a regular host of Match of the Day 2, is poised to succeed Lineker. Speaking to Metro courtesy of Free Bets, he said: ""I still tune in regularly. It is still a very good programme, full stop. ‘I know there is a lot of speculation over Gary at the moment. Would it surprise me if he left at the end of the season? Possibly no. ""But he has earned the right to make his own decision, there is no doubt there whatever. ""And in Chappers, there is a ready-made replacement if it goes that way. It will be up to Gary."" CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS Alongside his stints on Match of the Day 2, Chapman also presents on BBC Radio 5 Live and Sky Sports. But despite Chapman's pedigree, Lawrenson insists it will be a tough job should he take the helm on Match of the Day. He added: ""Replacing Gary, it’s a big role for whoever takes it. Before him, Des [Lynam] and Jimmy Hill did it for years and were wonderful but at the end of it all, your time comes. ""But the good thing for Gary is, I think he will decide. I don’t think the BBC will decide. He will decide if he wants to go. He has earned the right to do so. He’s earned the right to leave. ""He’s in his 60s now, I’m not sure what else he has going on that could possibly be a substitute for Match Of The Day because when you first leave it feels like someone has chopped your arm off. ""But he can do whatever he wants."""
Uefa issue two referees with huge bans after drunkenly taking road sign before Champions League clash,One of the officials has released a statement,Ciaran Wiseman,"14:31, 26 Oct 2024","14:31, 26 Oct 2024","Sport,Football","UEFA have banned two referees for drunkenly taking a road sign before a Champions League clash. Bartosz Frankowski and Tomasz Musial were arrested in the Polish city of Lubin back in August. The pair had been appointed as VAR and AVAR officials for the third qualifying round tie between Dynamo Kyiv and Rangers. However, they were replaced by the Polish FA following their drunken antics the night before the match. Police caught the two referees on CCTV before arresting them, with Uefa fining them at the time. Frankowski and Musial have now both been handed lengthy bans for their behaviour. They have been suspended until June 30, 2025 by Uefa's Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body. Their punishment is for breaking ""basic rules of decent conduct"", the governing body confirmed. In a statement, Frankowski said: ""I am still trying to find words that will sufficiently express how much I regret this incident and how sorry I am. ""I realise that with one such violation, I ruined 22 years of refereeing, ruined my entire career. I should have calmly prepared for the match and not gone anywhere. FOOTBALL FREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS ""As one of the police officers later told me, our prank was spotted by CCTV cameras and they intervened. I would like to clarify that we were in no way aggressive. These were stupid jokes. ""We did not suspect that it would be perceived this way. We had no bad intentions. It was stupidity, an idiotic fantasy, I don’t even know what to call it."" He also claimed the incident was simply a ""prank"" and had been a ""stupid game"" that went wrong. The 38-year-old, who is a Fifa referee, added: ""Now, looking back, I understand that it was not a very smart idea. ""It was a sign that was lying next to where road works were being carried out and we were passing by. ""I am very sorry that this happened. And on a purely human level, it was stupid, because I know that my unfortunate behaviour will cast a shadow on many years of hard work. ""What happened was irresponsible and unprofessional on my part, and I am fully aware of that. ""I would just like to emphasise that there were no acts of aggression in my behaviour, I did not break the law and there was no unlawful behaviour on my part towards police officers or anyone."""

I own UK’s tiniest home – it’s only as wide as a Ford Focus but housed family of 6 & was nearly destroyed for mad reason,Take a peek inside the astonishing property in our exclusive video,"Hayley Minn, Features writerHayley Minn, Features writer","10:09, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","10:09, 26 Oct 2024","Fabulous,Real Life","WHEN you’re a teeny height of 5”1, it’s not often you have to duck down to enter a building. But that’s exactly what I found myself doing, as I stepped into the smallest house in Great Britain. Nestled at the end of a terrace in Conwy, North Wales, the tiny home has a floor space of just 10ft by 5.9ft - meaning it's as wide as a Ford Focus. There’s just enough room inside this cosy house for a fireplace, stove, and ladder up to a bedroom with a single bed - but no bathroom. There’s certainly no space for a television, but that hasn’t stopped the TV licensing inspectors from knocking on owner Jan Tyley’s door. The 58-year-old solicitor's great-great grandfather, Robert Jones, bought the house for just £20 in 1891. And the Grade II listed building has been passed down the family ever since. “When I was little, it just seemed like it was part of family life,” Jan says. “But since I inherited it from my cousin Margaret in 2015, it’s been quite a boast. “When I tell people I own it, they react either with astonishment, or actually, quite a lot of people say, ‘Oh, I've been there. I know that.’ “The other question I get is, ‘What's the second smallest house in the country?’ The answer to which I have absolutely no idea!” The Smallest House, also known as Quay House, was built in the 16th century between two already-standing rows of cottages. The terraced houses had a space in the middle, left for one of Conwy Castle’s towers. Jan says: “It’s believed someone built the house here during the night, thanks to a rule that says if you can build a house after sunset and have smoke coming out of the chimney by sunrise, you can claim the plot as your own. “It only took a front and a roof to make it into a property.” While it’s not known who built the house, Jan has gone back through the census and found there have been many couples living together in the house. “When they did, they used to lower the trapdoor, up there, down and roll out a mattress to cover the whole floor, which is about the same size as a double bed,” she adds. Jan says the very maximum amount of people who can fit into the house comfortably is six, but there used to actually be a mum, dad and four children living in the tiny house. “The kids used to sleep on hammocks hung between the beams upstairs,” she says. “It’s absolutely crazy.” The last person to live here was a local fisherman called Richard Jones, who, amazingly, was 6”3. He was a sitting tenant when Jan’s great-great grandfather bought the property, occupying it until May 1900, when the building was condemned as being unfit for human habitation and he was forced to move out. Due to none of them having a toilet, the tiny house - along with the row of cottages to its left - were all about to be knocked down. “But my great-great grandfather, having only owned it for nine years, was sitting in the pub bemoaning his fate to his friends, when one of his friends, the editor of the local newspaper, Roger Dawson, said, ‘Well, it might be the smallest in the country!’” says Jan. Roger and Richard went ahead and put adverts in papers across the country, asking people to send details of their small houses, before travelling around Great Britain measuring them all. Indeed, Quay House in Conwy was the smallest, and they appealed to the council who agreed to leave it standing, as long as no one lived in it. It’s been open as a tourist attraction ever since. Jan says: “When my Auntie Lissy had it, she used to live next door, and she had a sign in the window saying, ‘Anybody who want to see inside the smallest house, come and knock on the door.’ ""So she would jump up from tea or dinner and open up the house so people could see inside. “So it wasn't quite the same tourist attraction back then as it is now.” These days, it’s open seven days a week, from 10am to 4pm, and receives around 50-60,000 visitors a year. That’s, in part, thanks to Jan’s relative Margaret, who she inherited the house from. Jan explains: “When it was lived in, and up until the 1970s, it was creamy-white outside, but it was Margaret who chose to paint it red. “She thought it would stand out, and red is a very Welsh colour, and, indeed, it was Margaret, too, who brought in the tradition of the ladies on the door wearing Welsh costumes.” The tiny house movement began in the USA before gaining popularity in the UK. What is a tiny home? Tiny houses are small, fully-equipped living spaces designed to lead a more sustainable, off-grid lifestyle. Although they vary in size and shape, tiny homes tend to be between 15 and 50 square metres in capacity, made of sustainable materials and are easier — and cheaper — to maintain than traditional brick homes. Are tiny homes legal in the UK? As long as the tiny house doesn't exceed 19.8m x 6.7m in size, it is defined as a caravan in UK law. Therefore, tiny houses are classed as legal additional living space. Can you get a mortgage for a tiny home? The small size and relatively low cost of tiny houses means they’re not generally considered eligible for a mortgage. However, there are plenty of options to take out a loan to fund your dreams of the perfect, moveable home. And last year, Jan moved from Oxford to Saint Asaph, 25 minutes away from the house, so she could check on it more regularly. She says: “There's always rolling maintenance we have to do. “Unfortunately, with the back wall being part of an ancient monument, it's not the driest of environments.” Sadly, Jan also has to deal with thieves. She says: “The most bizarre thing - we used to have the Bible on the bed upstairs. “We've got railings up there, because obviously we can't have thousands of people walking on the floor, and, somehow, somebody managed to get it from the far end of the bed out. Goodness knows how. “So now we don't put a Bible on the bed!” Of course, Jan doesn’t actually live in the house - and has no plans to. “I couldn’t,” she laughs. “I like my creature comforts too much!” But she has absolutely no plans to sell it. “Amazingly, we get people offering to buy it for £20 now, but I say no!” she laughs. Instead, she’s already lining up her youngest son, who is 22, as the heir to the smallest house.  “He’s very, very keen on taking it on in years to come,” she says. “He actually deputised for me last week, while I was on holiday, and he knows exactly what he’s doing.” By Jonathan Rolande Property expert Jonathan Rolande told Fabulous: The reason we are seeing more creative ways of finding a home: super-high property prices and rents. Younger people are remaining in the family home later in life to avoid paying high prices and to save for a deposit. With increasingly busy lives, staying within a larger family group makes sense, chores such as gardening and housework can be shared. Garages are rarely used for their intended purpose as cars are far more reliable and less prone to rust and so are perfectly happy outside. On the other hand, the amount of property space per person has been shrinking – converting a garage can make great sense. Things to consider. (the boring stuff) Usually easier than building from scratch but still a lot to do to turn a garage in to a habitable space. You’ll need to check if you need planning (more likely to be required if the garage is detached). Building Regulations stipulate many things to make homes safe and secure. Consider Walls, are they cavity? Roof height Windows How will you get plumbing, electrics and drainage connected Insulation – it will be cold! Fire safety Damp proofing Also consider if, by converting, you are adding or deducting value from the main home. Garages can add value in busy urban areas where parking is limited."
X Factor star Diana Vickers cheekily grabs her bum in lace bodysuit as she heads out for Halloween,The singer shot to fame 16 years ago on the ITV show,"Lucy Murgatroyd, Showbiz Reporter","15:51, 26 Oct 2024","16:16, 26 Oct 2024",TV,"X FACTOR star Diana Vickers cheekily grabbed her bum in a lace bodysuit as she heads out for Halloween. The 33-year-old, who shot to fame on the ITV show back in 2008, dressed up as a Victoria's Secret for the Hallowzeem Party in Covent Garden last night. Diana looked incredible in a white plunging thong body suit. She covered her modesty as she left the venue by covering her behind with her hand. The singer completed the look with a pair of silver open toe heels and kept warm in a long fur coat. Diana styled her blonde locks into some loose waves and opted for a soft make-up look. Other celebrities were in attendance, including Love Island stars, a TV host and a famous nepo baby. Fans will remember Diana will she took part in the ITV singing competition 16 years ago. The fifth series was won by Alexandra Burke and JLS were runners-up. During her time in the competition she was linked to Eoghan Quigg. Back in May the star was ‘humbled real quick’ when a barman made an EPIC error while guessing her age. Diana had been wanting to order a beer, and when she was asked for ID, she showed her passport on her phone. ""I was like, 'Babe, I'm 32!'"" Diana continued. The bar lady thought that she didn't even look over 25. ""I was secretly loving it but also just wanted my drink,"" she said.   The star  shared the ordeal on her TikTok page. Diana still has a huge fan base, 16 years on from her stint on X Factor. She's not released an album since 2013, but she's been busy doing other things.  The star is the host of the Ki & Dee: The Podcast. She also recently starred in the I Wish You Well - The Gwyneth Paltrow Ski Trial Musical as Gwyneth."
Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs ‘mixed celeb bashes with drug-fueled Freak Off sex parties after VMAs and Super Bowl’,Diddy is currently being held in a Brooklyn jail cell as he faces criminal charges for sex trafficking and racketeering,"Ellie Doughty, Foreign News ReporterEllie Doughty, Foreign News Reporter","11:56, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,",,Showbiz,"SEAN 'Diddy' Combs hosted wild sex parties dubbed ""Freak Offs"" alongside some of his infamous star-studded events, it has been claimed. A slew of videos and documents seen by The New York Post allege that the orgies were happening in plain sight - as Diddy rubbed shoulders with Hollywood's elite. One of his biggest parties took place in August 2005, after the MTV VMA music awards. The guest list was overflowing with huge names including Eva Longoria, Paris Hilton, Fergie, Jeff Gordon and Ice-T. At a certain point in the early hours of the next day, the bash moved from a nightclub to Diddy's Miami mansion. Photos and videos seen by the Post suggest that the gathering then descended into a wild sex party. The celebrities by that point had left, leaving only Diddy, 54, and a trove of naked or half-dressed young men and women. Footage allegedly showed Diddy wearing the same t-shirt he can be seen in snaps from the after-party that night. Couples could be seen having group sex in the video, with apparent evidence of drug use. While some of the footage dates appear incorrect, The Post says others are consistent with details, locations and clothing which has been used to verify their authenticity. At both the 2005 MTV after party, the same event in 2004 and the 2005 Super Bowl - Diddy appears to be throwing one of his wild orgy ""Freak Offs"", the footage suggests. A bombshell federal indictment against Diddy was released in September, claiming that he orchestrated days-long, drug-fuelled sex parties which he forced his victims to take part in. The disturbing allegations, including that he recorded blackmail videos at the events and that victims were left so fatigued that they needed IV drips to recover, were laid out in a grand jury indictment after his arrest in New York. The charges came less than a year after a lawsuit filed by Diddy's ex Cassie Ventura accused the rapper of physically and sexually abusing her for years. That suit also spurred a raft of other allegations made by alleged victims of the music mogul. According to prosecutors, Diddy threw wild parties he called ""freak offs"" where he would fly in sex workers for days of raucous sessions. Diddy is currently being held in a Brooklyn jail cell as he faces criminal charges for sex trafficking and racketeering. Attorney Tony Buzbee has said he is representing over 100 accusers in a series of civil claims he is in the process of filing against the mogul, who continues to deny all charges against him. Diddy's trial date for the criminal charges of sex trafficking and racketeering has been set for May 5 next year. By Forest McFarland, Senior News Reporter BEFORE Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' arrest on Monday night, it had been highly speculated that the rap star would find himself in custody after he was repeatedly hit with disturbing accusations - and had two of his mansions raided by the feds. His mounting legal troubles finally came to a head on September 17, when he was charged with three federal counts, including sex trafficking, for allegedly forcing victims to take part in drug-fueled sex parties he called ""Freak Offs."" Hours before his arrest, The U.S. Sun exclusively revealed the feds investigating Diddy were secretly liaising with Tupac Shakur murder prosecutors on gangland activities. The development also came after Diddy was named 77 times in documents submitted by prosecutors in the Tupac murder case. Aside from the Tupac probe, Diddy was already facing a slew of lawsuits, including one he settled with his ex, Cassie Ventura, after she accused him of rape and abuse. Disturbing hotel surveillance video from 2016 showed Diddy chasing Cassie down and then punching, kicking, and beating her in a hallway. Two months earlier, in March 2024, two of Diddy's mansions were raided by federal investigators, who seized three AR-15s, drugs, and 1,000 bottles of lube which were part of his ""Freak Off"" supplies. In addition to his federal criminal charges, Diddy also faces a handful of lawsuits with allegations of sexual assault, harassment, and sex trafficking dating back to the early 1990s. Music producer Rodney 'Lil Rod' Jones filed one suit in February 2024, claiming Diddy forced him to hire sex workers and participate in sex acts while he worked on his latest album. Diddy has denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty to the federal sex trafficking charges against him, but his battle is far from over. He faces life in prison if he's convicted on all counts."
6 top tips to get a good night’s sleep this winter ahead of clocks going back including why an egg is best for breakfast,Small adjustments to the time you hit the sheets can be useful to help cope,Laura Stott,"23:29, 25 Oct 2024","23:30, 25 Oct 2024","Health,News Health","IF your slumber suffers at this time of year, you are not alone. With the clocks going back on Sunday, many of us find resetting our routines to shorter days and darker evenings affects the ­quality of our shut-eye. Here, sleep psychotherapist Heather Darwall-Smith explains why the change alters our sleep, and how to adjust to ensure a good night’s kip all winter. SMALL adjustments to the time you hit the sheets can be useful to help cope. Heather says: “Consider shifting your bedtime and alarm call by 15 minutes in the three days before the clocks change. “Waking up at a consistent time keeps us functioning at our healthy best, both hormonally and biologically, for optimal digestion, energy, alertness and more. “But don’t get hung up on having earlier nights if you aren’t tired.“An overly rigid sleep-wake routine can increase sleep problems, so only go to bed earlier if you feel sleepy.” HEATHER says: “The clock change can be trickier for teenagers. Many have a delayed body clock already due to ­hormonal changes found in adolescence. “They’re inherently sleep-deprived thanks to a biologically late cycle, which means they aren’t tired at bedtime – but it’s not totally their fault! “Recognising this is essential, but gently prompting teens to reduce screen usage at night will help them to drop off and sleep better when they do turn in.” THE NHS recommends taking a vitamin D supplement between the months of ­September and April. This is when our body struggles to make enough on its own, owing to the reduction in sunlight. A good supplement can also help you get a decent kip during winter. Get in the habit of taking vitamin D daily through the darker months. Red meat and egg yolks are also good sources. HEATHER says: “Getting as much natural light as possible during the daytime and ­reducing it at night is key for good sleep. “It’s the primary external reset button for drop-offs and waking, so get up and out into the natural daylight, especially in the mornings if you can. “When it is overcast you will need to stay out for longer, but even on grey days the rays from the sun will tell the brain how to respond at bedtime. Morning movement also helps tell it that it’s time to be awake. “If you struggle not to hit ‘snooze’ at this time of year, a light-based alarm clock can help. It is also a softer way to wake up.” INCORPORATE more protein into your diet for better winter snoozes. Heather says: “Poor sleep often gets blamed for daytime energy dips when the issue may actually be blood sugar levels. “Regular mealtimes matter, so aim not to eat too early or too late at night. “A protein-based brekkie is ideal for all ages.” Try tucking into eggs, peanut butter on toast or porridge to start the day. FOR most people, the body will adjust to nodding off normally within three days. Heather says: “When the clocks go back, the mornings are lighter but our evenings get darker. It can be momentarily disorientating, but try not to worry about it.  “There is the likelihood of a few days of feeling sluggish. But if you worry, it will only make the impact worse.”"
Thousands of Tommy Robinson supporters chant ‘we want Tommy out’ & clash with cops after far-right activist charged,Robinson isn't attending after being remanded in custody yesterday,Sun ReporterSun Reporter,"14:12, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","18:11, 26 Oct 2024","News,UK News","THOUSANDS of Tommy Robinson supporters chanted ""we want Tommy out"" in central London today as they clashed with cops. Hordes of the political activist's followers gathered at Victoria Station and are marching on Whitehall today. Five arrests have been made at the demonstration, the Metropolitan Police said. Robinson - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - is missing the planned protest after he was remanded into police custody yesterday. Chants of ""Oh Tommy, Tommy"" and ""We want Starmer out"" were heard ahead of the Unite The Kingdom rally. The demonstration has been met with rival protesters from Stand Up to Racism, which has called on its supporters to ""take to the streets"" in a ""massive anti-fascist demonstration"". Robinson, 41, is accused of being in contempt of court after the airing of a film at a protest in Trafalgar Square in July. He attended Folkestone police station on Friday where he was remanded ahead of a hearing at Woolwich Crown Court on Monday. It concerns allegations that he breached a 2021 High Court order barring him from repeating libellous allegations against a Syrian refugee who successfully sued him. It is understood the airing of a film, titled Silenced, at the Trafalgar Square demonstration is one of six actions alleged to have breached the injunction between June and July. The film is also pinned to the top of his X account. Robinson was separately charged on Friday with failing to provide his mobile phone access code to police under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, Kent Police said. The Met Police and British Transport Police are being supported by officers from other forces across the country for the protests today. Cops promised a ""significant police presence"" to ensure the two groups are kept apart. One man has been pictured being detained by cops. The protest, organised by Robinson, marched from Victoria station to the southern end of Whitehall, while the counter-protest began at Regent Street St James's and finished at the northern end of Whitehall. One protester - who gave his name only as Chris - told The Sun: ""It [the rally] had to be done. ""With the state of things in this country, it was getting out of hand.” Asked if he was there to see a specific speaker, he added: ""None in particular. ""I’m just here to show some support."" The Met said static rallies are expected at the end of both marches. It is understood Robinson will be held in custody in Folkestone until his court hearing on Monday. He was released on unconditional bail in July and subsequently left the country - with Adam Payter, representing the Solicitor General, telling the High Court there ""was nothing to prevent him from doing so"". Mr Justice Johnson issued a warrant for Robinson's arrest but ordered that it not be carried out ""until early October"" to allow Robinson time to indicate that he would attend the next hearing voluntarily or to apply to ""set aside"" the warrant. Robinson posted a video of himself arriving at Luton Airport on October 20 and said he was surprised he had not been arrested.He applied to set aside the warrant but his application was dismissed by Mr Justice Johnson on Friday. The separate charge under the Terrorism Act relates to his arrest in July at a port in Kent, where he was accused of ""frustration"" of police counter-terrorism powers. He allegedly failed to provide his mobile phone access code to officers at the Channel Tunnel in Folkestone. Under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, police are allowed to stop anyone passing through a UK port ""to determine whether they may be involved or concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism"".  The person who is detained can be held for up to six hours, is legally obliged to answer questions and must provide the password or access number for electronic devices, or be held to have committed a criminal offence if they refuse. Robinson said he objected to a request from police for the number to his phone because there was privileged information on the device relating to an ongoing High Court case."
Chloe Ferry looks incredible in skintight dress as she makes very rare public appearance with boyfriend Johnny Wilbo,Chloe previously spoke to The Sun about her relationship with her on/off boyfriend Johnny,"Lottie Hulme, Senior Showbiz Reporter","14:27, 26 Oct 2024","16:20, 26 Oct 2024",TV,"CHLOE Ferry has been spotted looking incredible as she stepped out in a skin tight pink dress while on a rare public outing with her boyfriend. Since 2021, the Geordie Shore star has been on/off boyfriend with boyfriend Johnny Wilbo. And despite their rows and past rocky relationship, Chloe and Johnny proved that they’re very much back on, as they went on a date night to The Ivy restaurant in Manchester,  attending the launch of her new product with Isoclean. Chloe, 29, looked sensational as she wore her highlighted longs down in a long bob style and opted for a very glam makeup look. The Geordie Shore star chose a floor length figure hugging pink gown for the evening, which she partnered with black heels and a pink clutch bag. Johnny walked beside his girlfriend as they held hands and looked in good spirits, opting for a cream hoodie and jeans for their date night. The 29-year-old has tried to keep their reunion under wraps after he was caught cheating in 2022. She broke her silence on her relationship with Johnny in January this year after they'd enjoyed a romantic holiday in Thailand. Before this, she'd dumped him after he was caught messaging other women behind her back. However, at the time she urged fans not to judge her change of heart, insisting that ""there are a lot of things that people don't know"". On her relationship, Chloe previously told The Sun: ""It’s going alright, it’s like any relationship – there are ups and there’s downs. ""But it’s going alright to be honest, we’ve just been to Thailand together, we’ve actually had a really good holiday to be honest. ""If I’m still with him...because we’re up and down, if we are still together after summer, I’m having one last wild summer and then we’re going to start trying for babies.""   When asked if she now trusts him or if she's worried about history repeating itself, Chloe said: “There were a lot of reasons, I'm not me making excuses for him, but there were a lot of things that people didn’t know. ""I do trust him now, obviously we do argue about it, I’m not just going to forget about it. ""It’s always there in the back of my mind and that’s why we mainly argue a lot, because I always struggled with trusting someone because of the past I’ve had with my boyfriends from before. ""But we are trying to learn to trust each other but things are going good to be honest.”"
Chancellor to make huge change for millions of social renters in Budget,It's bad news for those considering buying their council house,"James Flanders, Chief Consumer ReporterJames Flanders, Chief Consumer Reporter","12:50, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","12:54, 26 Oct 2024","Money,News Money","MILLIONS of social renters will be impacted by huge changes when the Chancellor delivers her Autumn Statment on Wednesday. Rachel Reeves is set to announce plans for a new social housing rent settlement, resulting in rent increases above inflation over the next five years. The government plans to cap social housing rents at CPI inflation plus 1% and will consult on this five-year rent settlement. The consultation will also explore other options, such as a 10-year settlement. Additionally, the Chancellor will reduce Right to Buy discounts, which allow tenants to buy local authority-owned homes at a discount. This change aims to protect existing council housing stock. This overhaul will allow councils to retain 100% of the money from property sales, helping them to build more social housing. The moves are part of a housing package that includes £500 million in new funding for up to 5,000 new affordable social homes and £128 million to support delivering 33,000 other homes. Ms Reeves said: ""We need to fix the housing crisis in this country. It’s created a generation locked out of the property market, torn apart communities and put the brakes on economic growth. ""We are rebuilding Britain by ramping up housebuilding and delivering the 1.5million new homes we so badly need."" Darren Baxter, principal policy adviser at Joseph Rowntree Foundation, added: ""Investing in building social homes will make a real difference to the lives of people who are currently locked out of the economic security these homes could give them. ""It's welcome to see that alongside this investment, the government plans to take steps to reduce the number of homes lost to the private sector through the Right to Buy discounts. The outcome of the consultation on social housing rents could mean that millions of tenants face up to 10 years worth of inflation-busting rent hikes. The previous Conservative government capped social rent hikes to 7% earlier this year. However, Rachel Reeves plans to consult on a 5 to 10-year formula in October's Autumn Statement that will increase annual rents in England by the CPI measure of inflation plus an additional 1%. While housing associations are likely to welcome this move, it could worsen the cost of living for millions of tenants and potentially increase the government's benefits bill. However, Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, says: ""As inflation can spiral out of control very quickly, there needs to be mechanisms in place to protect tenants from extreme rent rises that put them at risk of becoming homeless."" Most social housing tenants receive full housing benefits from the government, meaning taxpayers often fund any social rent increases. However, around 30% of social tenants pay full rent and will be hit by future increases in full because they're not eligible for support. There are around four million households currently living in rented social housing. That means 1.2million households will face future bill hikes if the new formula eventually comes into force. However, the exact amount your rent will increase depends on your location, the size of your property, and the level of inflation. IF you rent from the council or a housing association, you can get help if you’re having problems affording your rent. If you miss a rent payment, you'll fall into 'arrears' and owe your council or housing associations. Fail to pay back what you owe and you could be evicted. If you can't afford your next rent payment, you should talk to your landlord as soon as possible. Call them and explain why you're struggling. Your landlord may be able to grant a temporary payment holiday or signpost you to other forms of help. It's worth asking if you can get a discretionary housing payment. This provides extra money from your local council to help pay your rent - you don't need to pay it back. It's always worth checking if you're getting any benefit payments you're entitled to. You can use several free calculators, such as Gov.uk, Citizen's Advice, MoneySavingExpert, StepChange, and Turn2Us, to help you get an estimate. In the decade to 2022/23, only 94,000 new council houses were built. However, over 212,000 were sold via right to buy, and another 58,000-plus were demolished. To counteract the significant loss of housing stock, the government plans to substantially reduce the Right to Buy privileges for social tenants. This could mean tenants must live in their homes for ten years - up from the current three - before being allowed to purchase.  For newly-built council homes, the option to buy could be scrapped altogether, preserving much-needed social housing stock. The exact details of the Right to Buy overhaul will be confirmed when Rachel Reeves delivers her Autumn Statement on Wednesday, October 30. RIGHT to Buy was introduced in 1980 by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government. The scheme allows people renting council homes (owned by local councils) to buy their homes at a discount. The longer you've lived in the property, the bigger the discount—up to 70 per cent off. It was designed to help tenants become homeowners, and millions of people have used it. However, the scheme has also led to a large reduction in available council homes, as many were sold and not replaced. This has contributed to a shortage of affordable housing for people in need."

Katya appeared happy after the dance but Wynne seemed exhausted. The opera singer crawled towards Yess Daly as he made his way to receive his comments from the judges. ""It lacked fluidity from move to move,"" said Craig. ""You're my sunshine and I adore you on the dance floor,"" said Motsi Mabuse as she was full of praise. ""Good steps, good to the music,"" said Shirley but she asked Wynne to rotate more during his dance. ""I'd call that being captured that dance... you didn't die so well done!,"" joked Anton. Last week the pair came under fire as viewers noticed they didn't appear much together in the Claudatorium. The Go Compare singer was not with his partner for a large duration of the show as he returned on-screen over halfway through the programme. With their next performance, will they finally be able to bush off the feud rumours? Dr Punam celebrated even when Craig and Shirley gave them a score of six each.

Shirley called parts of her dance ""fantastic"" as she said she couldn't be ""more please by your improvement.""  They will perform the Tango as the television doctor called the intensity ""super fun"" in her rehearsal VT. Motsi Mabuse turned towards Anton Du Beke when he gave Montell a score of eight.

""You got all the ingredients right!"" said Shirley Ballas as she continued to play Bette Midler's popular character. ""Wonderful characterisation, the whole thing remained in character ... strong performance,"" said Anton as he remarked that he wanted to see faster leg speed on Montell's latin dances.

""She came and she brought 20 guests. So, she wanted 21 tickets, and we were like 'okay',"" said Cassandra. ""We give her the tickets, and she comes backstage and she asked if I could take pictures with all of her friends and relatives she brought. ""I take a picture with every single one of them. I sign autographs for every single one of them. ""Then I say to her ‘Can we take a photo together?’ and she goes, ‘Nah, I don’t really do that.’"" To add further insult to injury, the star shared: ""She left before my show started and all her relatives stayed... and she took off. Okay! Just sayin'.” A presenter at the convention reportedly reacted with: ""Ariana is playing the wrong witch in the upcoming Wicked movie."" Another took to X, formerly Twitter to air her outrage, saying: ""The Ariana Grande and Elvira story is actually insane and Ariana should be investigated."" Another said: ""...could never imagine being so disrespectful."" And one fan added: ""Ariana Grande being typical Ariana Grande. Classless and all filled up with self-importance."" But fans of Ariana's were quick to defend the star, with one saying: ""... I can understand Elvira, I too would still hold resentment after almost a decade I missed my only opportunity to take a picture with THE Ariana Grande.""   Ariana has since responded to the claims and commented to Cassandra: ""I’m so disheartened to see this. ""I actually don’t even remember getting the chance to meet you because I had an anxiety attack and to my memory, left before the rest of my family (this was around 7 years ago and at the time i was really not great with being in public crowds or loud places)…"" She added: "" But if i’m misremembering this moment, I sincerely apologise for offending you so."" Ariana got her first break in the Broadway musical 13 and went on to act in the Nickelodeon series Victorious. Victorious. Then she signed with Republic records in 2011 where her rise to pop stardom and fame began. Recently she has returned to acting with a star role in Wicked. Wicked is the prequel to The Wizard of OZ which tells the story of life of Elphaba who is a nice girl until society's disapproval turns her Wicked. Meanwhile, Elvira's Movie Macabre led to Cassandra's biggest role as Elvira in the 1988 film Elvira: Mistress of the Dark and the 2001 film Elvira's Haunted Hills.  The tv show rose up from the dead in 2010 with Elvira hosting public domain films on This TV until 2011 followed by various spin offs. Elvira is available on Amazon Prime."
TV legend set for new chat show podcast from beyond the grave as AI will recreate his distinctive voice,His son has given his backing to the project for which a string of potential interview subjects have been identified,"Rod McPhee, TV Editor","19:46, 25 Oct 2024","21:54, 25 Oct 2024","TV,News TV","SIR Michael Parkinson will continue as the chat show king from beyond the grave — thanks to Artificial Intelligence. The technology will be used to recreate Parky’s distinctive voice as he quizzes famous names for a podcast. His son Michael has given his backing to the project for which a string of potential interview subjects have been identified. An insider told The Sun: “The fact that a bizarre project like this is being pursued is a measure of just how adored Parky was and how missed he now is. “Although it sounds strange, using AI like this will keep the memory of the grand inquisitor alive and remember him for doing what he did best — grilling famous people.” Proud Yorkshireman Sir Michael died after a brief illness last August aged 88. He found fame presenting his TV talk show Parkinson from 1971 to 1982, and 1998 to 2007. He hosted other chat shows and programmes in the UK and abroad.   In his early years he interviewed some of the world’s biggest stars including Bing Crosby, Bette Davis, Muhammad Ali, Helen Mirren and Billy Connolly. His many other memorable telly moments include his clash with Rod Hull and his aggressive puppet Emu in 1976 and his infamously frosty interview with actress Meg Ryan in 2003."
Prison guards joked about assaulting Boris Becker & mocked suicide of inmate in leaked WhatsApp msgs,Becker was at Wandsworth for a few weeks as part of his two and a half year sentence,"Milad Sherzad, News Reporter","23:57, 25 Oct 2024","23:57, 25 Oct 2024","News,UK News","PRISON guards joked about assaulting tennis champion Boris Becker and mocked the suicide of a young inmate in a series of leaked WhatsApp messages. Warders at HMP Wandsworth quipped about serving the Wimbledon champ some “new balls” and giving him a “back hander” after he arrived at the prison in 2022 to start a two-and-a-half year sentence for hiding his assets. After one officer said how Becker “looked scared when he came in last night”, another, Kevin O’Farrell, asked “did you give him a back hander?” O’Farrell added: “Would have been ace. Love to have seen that. “He’ll see some new balls tonight that’s for sure.” Becker was at Wandsworth for a few weeks as part of his two and a half year sentence, of which he served eight months, for concealing £2.5 million of assets during a bankruptcy case. In WhatsApp messages obtained by The Times, prison guards also ridiculed a 21-year-old prisoner who took his own life, saying they hoped he “suffered” and described his death as “splendid” just hours after the incident. Officer Armin Naroozi also posted a gif of a man dancing alongside the words “another one bites the dust” in light of the young adult’s suicide. The group of guards were found to have also joked that it would be “good to see” some inmates tasered, while they regularly made homophobic and misogynistic remarks. Almost 30 members of staff, including at least one senior figure, were part of the WhatsApp group. Yesterday, a spokesman for Becker said that he previously had no knowledge of the “disturbing chat history” in the WhatsApp group. The content “does not match his experiences in HMP Wandsworth”, adding: “The prison staff have always behaved decently and respectfully towards him.” The Prison Service said that it had strengthened its vetting processes and introduced a whistleblowing helpline. A spokeswoman said: “This was truly despicable behaviour that tarnishes the hard work of the overwhelming majority of our prison staff. “The two officers involved were dismissed last year when these messages came to light and their actions were reported to police. ""Where officers do fall below our high standards, robust action will be taken as was the case here.”"
Putin’s next battleground revealed as knife-edge vote ‘paves way for new Hitler-style land grab’ in Europe,Watch how Putin could try and take over the country above,James HalpinJames Halpin,"13:32, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","14:18, 26 Oct 2024","News,World News","A KNIFE-EDGE vote has paved the way for Vladimir Putin's next land grab, experts have warned. The Russian tyrant is now eyeing-up seizing Moldova, analysts say, after it voted this week to move towards joining the EU. Vlad must act now to stop it from forever leaving Russia's orbit and is set to drawing his moves from his Ukraine playbook. Moldova's razor-thin - 50.39 per cent to 49.61 per cent - vote to constitutionally enshrine joining the EU this week comes after two shock accusations of Russian interference. President Maia Sandu accused Moscow on Monday of trying to buy the vote of 300,000 people (about 20 per cent of the total vote) with ""millions of Euros"" on offer. And last week, the country's spymaster accused Wagner of training pro-Russian Moldovans to protest against the government at ""guerrilla camps"" in Serbia. Experts told The Sun these grey zone tactics show Putin is using the same playbook that preceded his Ukraine invasion as he seeks to make it part of his new Russian Empire. Orysia Lutsevych, Deputy Director of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House said the ""game was on"" as Putin looks for a ""quick win"". Lutsevych said Putin's plan wasn't a theoretical scheme - but is in its early stages. She said the 72-year-old is looking to destabilise Moldova and challenge the result of the election if the pro-Russian candidate doesn't win. She said: ""[Putin] is consistent in his vision, that it [Moldova] belongs to him, and, as we see with Ukraine, he's willing to take high losses, pay a high, high price."" Lutsevych said that Putin could try and formulate a reverse colour revolution by destabilising and then overthrowing the pro-Western government in favour of a Russian one. She said: ""It's similar to how Ukraine was before the 2013 uprising, where Russians were trying to get their way politically and by corruption by buying in voters."" Inside Moldova exists two breakaway regions, Transnistria and Gagauzia, which align with Russia. Lutsevych said they could be used by Putin similar to how he used the annexing of Crimea as a ""springboard"" into a greater invasion of Ukraine. She said: ""He's interested in Moldova as a whole and these territories would only be as a ways to get his goals to the to control. ""I think he may use these territories as clubs to incapacitate Moldova first and then eventually get it in full-fledged control."" Another way Putin could strike is if he was able to build a land bridge to Moldova through Ukraine as part of the invasion. Lutsevych said: ""If Putin is making land gains along the Black Sea [in Ukraine] Moldova may collapse."" If Moldova were to become a proxy-Russian state that would also add another hostile country next to Ukraine. President Sandu won the first round of the election on October 20 with 42 per cent of the vote. But there are fears now the opposition could gang up on her and back the pro-Russian candidate competing against her in the second round. Christina Harward, Russia Researcher at the Institute for the Study of War, wrote in a report last week that Moldova is a ""battleground"" state. She told The Sun Putin is already spreading disinformation and could look to foment violence in the country as a way to prevent it shifting to the West's camp. Harward said: ""Destabilization and chaos... serve the Kremlin's interests as Russia tries to drive a wedge in Moldovan society and keep Moldova from gaining EU membership. But Transnistria's economy, largely under the control of former KGB officer Viktor Gushan, would greatly benefit from access to the EU market. Harward said: ""Having another post-Soviet state move closer to the West - and become more prosperous and democratic in the process - would be yet another reputational blow to Russia.  ""Gushan's interests are tied to his businesses so he is very sensitive to policy changes that affect Transnistria's economy and his businesses' ability to continue their operations - including on the black market. ""When Ukraine closed its border with Moldova, Gushan's businesses were hurt so Gushan reoriented to the West to EU markets. So one of Gushan's main priorities is likely maintaining his access to EU markets."" By James Halpin, Foreign News Reporter Transnistria and Gagauzia are both regions formally inside Moldova - but both have tight links to Russia. In fact, Transnistria, in particular, is so tight with Russia that the Institute at the Study for War considers the country to be occupying it. It occupies a thin strip of land in between the Ukrainian border and the Dnister River which snakes its way down to the Black Sea. Christina Harward, a Russia Researcher at ISW, said Russian troops have occupied the strip of land since it became independent. She told The Sun Transnistria is already functionally part of Putin's wider empire - with Russia still having 1,500 troops there. Its security service, the MGB, drew most of its leaders from Russia's FSB, she said. She said: ""Russia sent military personnel to support Transnistrian separatists in 1992 after the fall of the USSR and Moldova's independence, and Russia has since maintained about 1,500 troops in Transnistria. ""Moldova has repeatedly asserted that Russia must withdraw these forces from Moldovan territory, but little progress has been made on this issue. ""Transnistria held a referendum in 2006 in which 98% said that they support Transnistria's continued ""independence"" and subsequent accession to Russia. ""But there has been no movement towards Russia's actual annexation of Transnistria."" Harward said the Kremlin had increased its ties to the other pal inside the country - Gagauzia - since March this year. Its governor, Irinia Vlah, is running on a pro-Russian platform at this election. But Harward says there are differences in the two regions' relationship wit Moldova. She said: ""The biggest difference is that Gagauzia is actually integrated into Moldova's government, economy, and society, whereas Transnistria is a parastate."" Harward said Transnistrian actors had their own interests that didn't always align with Russia. ""Gagauzian officials, led by Gagauzia's governor Yevgeny Gutsul, have been very open about their support for the Kremlin, with Gutsul having held multiple public meetings with Kremlin officials, including with Putin himself."""
Trump admits making ‘one big mistake’ in his presidency reveals what he was told about UFOs in Joe Rogan podcast,Rogan pushed Trump on his claims of election rigging in the 2020 polls,"Ellie Doughty, Foreign News Reporter","10:26, 26 Oct 2024","17:01, 26 Oct 2024","News,US News","DONALD Trump appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast on Friday night in a  lengthy three-hour chat about his attempted assassination, UFOs and the ""one big mistake"" he made while in the White House. The former president said he made ""bad choices"" when he selected members of his cabinet - claiming he owes his ""success"" to his own decision-making. He told The Joe Rogan Experience: ""The one mistake… I will say it always comes back to the same answer, the biggest mistake I made… I picked some people that I shouldn't have picked."" Trump described them as ""neocons, or bad people, or disloyal people"". A 'neocon', short for neoconservative, is someone who has conservative or right wing politics, believes strongly in the free market and is a proponent for military intervention abroad. Trump, 76, named his longest-serving White House chief of staff John Kelly and John Bolton, his national security adviser, as among those he regrets selecting. Both men are vocal critics of the Republican nominee - with Kelly recently doubling down on claims that Trump is a fan of Adolf Hitler and warned he would ""govern like a dictator if allowed"". Kelly, who worked with Trump from 2017 to 2019, recently called him ""the definition of a fascist"" in an interview with the New York Times. Meanwhile Bolton told The Daily Beast that ""Trump is too stupid to be a true fascist"". Trump dubbed Kelly a ""bully"" and an ""idiot"" on Rogan's show. He also showed off the ""tiny little mark"" on his ear from an assassination attempt at one of his rallies in Pennsylvania, in July. Speaking about it, he said: ""When I got shot, it wasn't surreal. ""When I was laying on the ground, I knew exactly what was going on. ""I knew exactly where I was hit. ""They were saying you've been hit all over the place because there was so much blood from the ear."" He added: ""It's not like some of the wrestlers some of the UFC fighters... But it makes me a tougher guy."" When Rogan asked him if he had been given any classified information on the existence of aliens, Trump simply said: ""They told me a lot"". Speaking about Joe Biden's 2020 election win, Trump told Rogan: ""That election was so crooked, it was the most crooked election. ""They were supposed to get legislative approval to do the things they did, and they didn't get it in many cases, they didn't get it. ""Like for extensions of the voting, for voting earlier. All this different things. By law, they had to get legislative approvals. ""You don't have to go further than that. If you take a look at Wisconsin, they virtually admitted that the election was rigged, robbed, and stolen."" When Rogan asked if Trump had an evidence to prove his claims about election rigging - the former president steered the conversation to claims that Hunter Biden had a laptop delivered from Russia just before the election. Podcast host Rogan has made headlines in the past over controversial comments about the Covid pandemic, vaccines and the AIDS epidemic. He has previously refused to host Trump on his show - saying in 2022 that he didn't want to help the Republican party's campaign. Rogan previously said: ""I am not a Trump supporter in any way, shape, or form. I've had the opportunity to have him on my show more than once - I've said no, every time…I don't want to help him. I'm not interested in helping him.""  On Friday's episode he said to the former president: ""There's probably no one in history that I've ever seen that's been attacked the way you've been attacked and the way they've done it so coordinated and systematically. Rogan added: ""You have said a lot of wild s**t."""

Baba Vanga and Nostradamus made the same chilling 2025 prediction that could ‘devastate Europe,Scroll to see what other predictions seem to have come true,"Zeenia Naqvee, Foreign News Reporter","15:03, 26 Oct 2024","16:01, 26 Oct 2024","News,World News","BABA Vanga and Nostradamus made the same chilling 2025 prediction that could ""devastate Europe"". The famed psychics alluded to a deadly war with the ability to plague Europe as early as next year. Ancient French astrologer Michel de Nostredame, commonly known as Nostradumus, was renowned for making accurate predictions into the future. The 16th century physician wrote how the ""lands of Europe"" would be involved in ""cruel wars"" - perhaps linked to Putin's evil war on Ukraine. He also added: ""The ancient plague will be worse than enemies."" Meanwhile, Bulgarian mystic Baba, born Vangeliya Pandeva Gushterova in 1911, said Europe's population would be at great risk. This could be referencing the ongoing brutality in Ukraine where several thousands of innocent civilians have been slaughtered. The blind woman, who has made predictions years ago about the historic events of this century, spoke explicitly of Putin's victory. During a meeting with writer Valentin Sidorov in 1979 Vanga said: ""All will thaw, as if ice, only one remain untouched - Vladimir’s glory, glory of Russia."" She added: ""All will be removed by her from the way and not only will be kept, but also becomes the lord of the world."" Shortly before her death, the elderly woman seemed to speak World War Three into existence: ""Russia will not only survive, it will dominate the world."" Her claims have been linked to tragic events such as September 11 and the War in Ukraine. Baba Vanga's successful predictions were said to have an 85 per cent success rate, including that Putin could win the 2018 election. Other things she predicted accurately were the Kursk nuclear submarine disaster. In 1980, Baba said Kursk will be ""covered with water and the whole world will weep over it"" claiming the disaster would happen in August 1999. The Russian sub sank in August 2000, killing all aboard. The Bulgarian healer is also said to have predicted the rise of the terror group ISIS. Another chilling claim that has proven to been spoken into existence is that the US's 44th president would be black - and Obama served as  the country's first African-American leader. In 1989, Baba claimed the ""American brethren will fall after being attacked by the steel birds... and innocent blood will be gushing"". Some believe this is a reference to the horrific September 11 attacks on the US in 2001. But not everything she has predicted has been true as she also said the US would cease to have a line of presidents following the 44th.       "
Take a glimpse at Disney’s first ever SEA rollercoaster with ‘thrilling high-speed circuit’ – as launch date revealed,Two other rides will also be on the Marvel Landing on the cruise ship,"Jon Rogers, News reporter","14:34, 26 Oct 2024","14:34, 26 Oct 2024","Travel,News Travel","THIS is a peek at Disney’s first ever sea rollercoaster, featuring a “thrilling high-speed circuit” – as the launch date is revealed. An Iron Man-themed rollercoaster called Ironcycle Test Run, will debut on the Disney Adventure cruise ship, along with two other rides as part of the Marvel Landing area. Passengers will be able to test drive the new rollercoaster when the cruise ship sets sail for the first time in December 2025. The Ironcycle Test Run will be Disney Cruise Line’s first traditional rollercoaster and the longest coaster at sea, at 820 feet Ironcycle Test Run will be part of Marvel Landing, a themed deck area which will include the Pym Quantum Racers go-karts and the Groot Galaxy Spin flat ride. Disney says the Ironcycle Test Run riders will “test-drive Tony Stark’s latest Ironcycle prototype on a thrilling high-speed circuit” and also participate in “a rapid-fire driving lesson from Tony Stark’s virtual assistant, F.R.I.D.A.Y.” Kerry Condon voices F.R.I.D.A.Y. in the Marvel films and is also known for her Oscar-nominated role in The Banshees of Inisherin and Better Call Saul. Condon also stars in “Star Wars: Skeleton Crew,” debuting on Disney+ in late 2024. The ride is being touted by Disney as its first rollercoaster on a cruise ship. Other Disney ships have variations of the AquaMouse attraction but that is a “water coaster”, where riders sit in rafts, which are propelled along a slide path by jets and magnets. Ironcycle Test Run is Disney Cruise Line’s first example of a more traditional rollercoaster – featuring a vehicle travelling quickly along a track. The track will sit 30 feet above the Marvel Landing deck. It will be Disney’s second rollercoaster featuring Iron Man. The first is Avengers Assemble: Flight Force, where the hero co-stars with Captain Marvel. The ride in Walt Disney Studios Park at Disneyland Paris opened in 2022, as a re-theme of the park’s previous Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster. Other Marvel rollercoasters around the world include Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind at Epcot in Florida and a forthcoming Spider-Man rollercoaster at Shanghai Disneyland. Two other rides will also be on the Marvel Landing on the cruise ship. Pym Quantum Racers is a go-kart-style attraction inspired by the car chase sequences of 2018’s Ant-Man and the Wasp. On Groot Galaxy Spin, guests will “fly their own Nova Corp Bass Jumper vehicles” in a themed ride based on Guardians of the Galaxy.  Elsewhere on board, the Avengers Assemble! live stage show will feature live character appearances by Spider-Man, Ms. Marvel, Black Widow, Black Panther, Taskmaster, Captain America, Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Thor, Loki, and Deadpool. The Disney Adventure cruise ship will sail three- and four-night voyages from Singapore starting on December 15, 2025."

Their outing comes after The Sun exclusively revealed last month how Andy, 35, and ex-wife Billi Mucklow, 36, had secretly split in July. Earlier this month, it was revealed that Andy had moved on with Lou, and last night they ventured out for their first showbiz bash together. The new celebrity couple looked loved up as they posed for photos outside the Hallozeem bash in London. Andy was dressed as Taylor Swift's boyfriend Travis Kelce, but it was unclear who Lou was meant to be - although she could have been trying to emulate the superstar singer. After the party had ended, they were seen holding hands and heading home together. The new couple have been inseparable ever since The Sun revealed how they had got together, following his split from wife Billi. The pair recently jetted off on their first holiday together and couldn't keep their hands off each other as they lounged around in the sun in Mallorca. Back home, his ex-wife Billi Mucklow appeared to take a cryptic swipe at Andy whilst he was off on vacation with his new girlfriend. She took to her Instagram story to share a sweet snap with her kids at home. The former Towie star and the youngsters looked cosy as they posed for a selfie together in their pyjamas. Billi and Andy share three kids Alro, eight, Wolf, five, and Marvel, three. Footballer Andy is also dad to Emilie Rose, 14, and Lucas, 13,   Billi captioned the post: ""I love you so much.""

""They want the process to be straightforward for everyone involved. Andy has been throwing himself into his football.” It was reported that Billi felt “blindsided” by him dating Lou so soon after their separation. A source has now told the Mail: ""It was a shock for Billi, given they only split months previously. ""It left her blindsided initially but he’s single now, so he can do what he wants. ""But what she doesn’t want to do is cause any fallouts between herself and Andy for the sake of the kids."" Lou split from ex Jay Morton in January last year. Billi and Andy were together for 11 years and wed at the Four Seasons Hotel in Hampshire in 2022. However that almost didn’t happen after a photograph from Andy’s stag do in Dubai showed him in bed with two women.  Billi shot to fame on ITVBe's Towie.

I cheated on my fiance with his brother & now I’m planning on swapping the grooms so my wedding can still take place,Scroll down to discover the telltale signs that your partner might be cheating on you,"Yasmin Harisha, Senior writerYasmin Harisha, Senior writer","9:52, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","11:47, 26 Oct 2024","Fabulous,Relationship advice","A 25-YEAR-OLD woman has confessed to cheating on her fiancé with his older brother and is now reconsidering her upcoming wedding. She met the brothers, Hugo, 26, and Michael, 28, in middle school when she was 13. Despite having a soft spot for both of them, Michael was the first to flirt with her. However, the woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, thought Michael was ""too old for her,"" so she decided to pursue a relationship with Hugo instead. Fast forward to the present, she has realised that she lost feelings for Hugo ""a long time ago."" Her infidelity, she admits, was ""the final push she needed to come to this realisation."" Confused at what to do, the young woman has taken to Reddit to seek advice from others and ask people for their thoughts. In a lengthy post, she wrote: “A little backstory on how we met: I met Hugo and his brother in middle school when I was 13. “I got to know Michael beforehand and got along with him much better. “He was 16 and flirted with me a lot, but I told him he was too old for me. “He was very sad about it but said that if I later married his brother, I would still be part of the family. “Hugo and Michael both gave me their numbers, leaving it up to me to decide which of them I wanted to get to know better. “I chose Hugo because we didn't have such a huge age difference as Michael and I did, although I actually wanted Michael. “So Hugo and I got to know each other better, met more often, and got together when I was 15 and he was 16. “We were in a relationship for years, but my heart was with Michael the whole time. “I put it off because I didn't want to hurt Hugo; he really does everything for me, and I can feel how much he loves me. We talked, and eventually, one thing led to another, and we went to the toilets together “I've met Michael from time to time when I was at Hugo's house or at family gatherings, and it gave me the impression that he wanted me as much as I wanted him. “Of course, that wasn't good at all, and I'm aware of that. I went on living like this for years, and when Hugo proposed to me in September last year, I was so relieved. “I thought that now I would only love Hugo and forget about Michael or that he wouldn't be as present in my mind anymore. Wrong. “Hugo and Michael's aunt got married for the third time last week and the whole family was there, including Michael. And that's when it happened.   “Hugo talked to his family members all evening, and I was kind of alone. “But that was okay with me because I already knew everyone well, and at that point, I had quite a headache from the loud music. “So I distanced myself from the revellers and, of course, met Michael. ""He wanted to keep me company, and I agreed. Michael and I want to be together and finally be happy after all these years “We talked, and eventually, one thing led to another, and we went to the toilets together. By the way, we were both still sober when I cheated, so we really wanted it. “Writing this, I realise how messed up everything is. “After Michael and I had sex, we were both very shocked at first. I said that it was not a mistake but exactly what I had wanted for years - him. “Michael confessed his love to me and told me how frustrating it was for him over the years, knowing that his brother was with the woman he loved. “Michael and I want to be together and finally be happy after all these years. “I haven't told Hugo anything about my infidelity yet, and neither has Michael. “Michael and I are now considering cancelling the wedding and gently telling Hugo. “I don't want to leave him standing at the altar and say no in front of the whole family.

""You should also look at how they place their phone down when not in use. If they face the phone with the screen facing down, then they could be hiding something."" They start telling you less about their day When partners cheat they can start to avoid you, this could be down to them feeling guilty or because it makes it easier for them to lie to you. ""If you feel like your partner has suddenly begun to avoid you and they don't want to do things with you any more or they stop telling you about their day then this is another red flag."" ""Partners often avoid their spouses or tell them less about their day because cheating can be tough, remembering all of your lies is impossible and it's an easy way to get caught out,"" says Aaron. Their libido changes Your partner's libido can change for a range of reasons so it may not be a sure sign of cheating but it can be a red flag according to Aaron. Aaron says: ""Cheaters often have less sex at home because they are cheating, but on occasions, they may also have more sex at home, this is because they feel guilty and use this increase in sex to hide their cheating.  You may also find that your partner will start to introduce new things into your sex life that weren't there before."" They become negative towards you Cheaters know that cheating is wrong and to them, it will feel good, this can cause tension and anxiety within themselves which they will need to justify. ""To get rid of the tension they feel inside they will try to convince themselves that you are the problem and they will become critical of you out of nowhere.  Maybe you haven't walked the dog that day, put the dishes away or read a book to your children before bedtime.  A small problem like this can now feel like a big deal and if you experience this your partner could be cheating,"" warns Aaron. “I would like to spare him that humiliation. It's bad enough that I cheated on him with his brother. “I've finally realised that I haven't had any feelings for Hugo for a long time. I don't want to continue with my life like this anymore. It's not fair to Hugo either. “So my question now is: How can Michael and I tell Hugo? How do I tell Hugo that I love Michael? “What are Michael and I supposed to do, and what are we going to do about the wedding now? I don't want to marry Hugo. You and Michael are absolutely awful human beings. You deserve everything that’s coming to you. “Can the wedding take place and instead I marry Michael? Would something like that work? “I'm pretty desperate right now because I finally want to be with Michael, but I don't want to cheat on Hugo again.” Her post naturally gained a lot of attention, with many people rushing to the comments section to share their thoughts. Many couldn’t believe that she was even considering if the wedding could take place. Others called her “stupid” for being in such a situation. One wrote: “You and Michael are absolutely awful human beings. You deserve everything that’s coming to you. “Do you seriously think you could just swap him in for Hugo at the wedding and there’ll be no backlash? “I’d be shocked if anyone in the family even thinks about you or Michael after this. I hope it was worth it, because your relationship with Michael will crash and burn. “He’s not as great a guy as you think he is, and you’re terrible yourself. You two cheaters deserve each other.” Another added: “There is no “gently” telling Hugo that his fiancée cheated on him with his brother.  “This is the worst nightmare territory and will likely rip their family apart for a good long while.” A third said: “That’s the family gathering at Christmas ruined then.” Welcome to Dear Deidre, your go-to for sound, judgement-free advice and practical support.

Terrifying moment football thugs launch firecrackers and stones at train filled with rival supporters,Ex-Arsenal youngster on bench for side who had supporters attacked,"Joshua Jones, Sport ReporterJoshua Jones, Sport Reporter","15:15, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","15:15, 26 Oct 2024","Sport,Football,Bundesliga","FOOTBALL thugs launched firecrackers and stones at a train filled with rival supporters in terrifying scenes. Video footage showed windows of the carriages smashed and explosions going off beside the tracks. According to Waz in Germany, approximately 700 Rot-Weiss Essen fans were making the long train journey for their side's third-tier league clash away at Hansa Rostock on a special train service across the country. But the early train - which apparently set off at 2.30am on Saturday morning - was stopped around 9.45am due to thick fog. It is understood the emergency brake had been deployed. But while stationary, the train was attacked by yobs. An estimated 200 assailants launched various missiles towards the carriage including rocks which cracked the windows. The football criminals were decked out in masks to cover their identity. But it is reported they are likely to be Hansa Rostock fans. Around 150 Essen supporters allegedly got off the train and clashed with the rivals outside the carriages. Due to the nature of the unexpected stoppage of the train, it is understood the clash between the rivals was not a pre-arranged meeting for the dust-ups. Police confirmed the incident to local media and that investigations are ongoing. Here are all the games that will be televised in December...

The Waz report added that kick-off in the first league meeting between the two teams since 2007 was delayed by 30 minutes. But although a replacement train was arranged, it was unclear whether the 700 travelling supporters would make it Rostock for the start of the match. In total, 2,000 Essen fans were heading to northern Germany to watch their team in 3 Liga action - with ex-Arsenal youngster Thomas Eisfeld on the bench."

How Brits can get fully funded home upgrades that will help save money on energy bills,,Brijiena Lovelace,"14:02, 12 Jul 2024","11:54, 12 Oct 2024",Money,"THE cost of living crisis in the UK means that the prices of everything from rent and mortgage to food and heating are becoming increasingly challenging for many households. With lower-than-expected temperatures during winter months, many Brits are looking for effective ways to heat their homes without breaking the bank. Luckily help is out there, but many are unaware of where to turn to and what can be done to help. That’s where Retrofit the Nation comes in, the dedicated initiative is tasked with helping Brits make their homes more energy-efficient. The organisation supports the government’s COP2035 objectives to make Britain more energy efficient through many schemes. There are billions of pounds allocated to these efforts that many Brits are eligible to access but may not know about. A substantial portion of these allocated funds are not spent each year due to a lack of awareness among eligible consumers. But Retrofit the Nation aims to help keep consumers fully informed and offer expertise and support throughout the process. Through fully funded schemes, homeowners, renters and landlords can reduce everyday energy consumption, which in turn helps lower energy bills. Retrofit the Nation provides expert installers to fit new boilers, heating systems and more, delivering fuss-free upgrades. These upgrades not only offer long-term money-saving benefits, but recipients also benefit from living in a home with proper insulation, modern heating systems and effective ventilation measures to maintain an ideal temperature all year round. Eco-conscious consumers can implement changes under these schemes to help reduce carbon emissions, which can also help increase the value of their property.   Applying for a grant is a straightforward process designed to be user-friendly and simple to access. All you have to do is complete a short form provided by Retrofit the Nation and they will use that information to recommend what schemes and grants you are eligible for. The application process then continues with a detailed survey of your property. This survey is essential to assess which specific energy-efficient upgrades can be installed, ensuring that the improvements are customised to meet the unique needs of each home. By tailoring upgrades to a property's unique requirements, Retrofit the Nation ensures maximum benefit for every eligible household. The Energy Company Obligation (ECO) 4 scheme is a government initiative aimed at improving the energy efficiency of homes in the UK. Under this scheme, energy companies are required to fund the installation of energy-efficient measures in eligible homes. The ECO 4 scheme targets homes that are in the most need of improvement, particularly those occupied by low-income households or individuals receiving certain benefits. The upgrades funded by this scheme can include insulation, heating system replacements, or other measures designed to reduce energy consumption. There are several different routes that make people eligible for the ECO 4 grant. These include: The value of the ECO 4 grant can vary depending on the specifics required to improve the efficiency of a home. Typically, the grant can cover the full cost of the improvements, so homeowners, tenants and landlords won’t need to pay out of pocket.  With energy bills on the rise, the potential savings from improved energy efficiency can provide a much-needed relief for many households across the country."
Inside the dark world of randy sex pest dolphins who terrorise swimmers & try to ROMP with humans,Watch footage of how dolphins often strike on swimmers by dragging them into deep water,"Georgie English, Foreign News ReporterGeorgie English, Foreign News Reporter","10:28, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","10:28, 26 Oct 2024","News,World News","RANDY sex pest dolphins have been terrorising swimmers at an alarming rate in recent years through a string of dangerous attacks. Dolphin welfare experts told The Sun there are many reasons why the beloved animals may turn on humans and revealed why victims often feel as if they've been sexually assaulted underwater. Vicious dolphins have been emerging across the globe in recent years with Japan being hit hardest by an alarming number of strikes. Local authorities across Japanese beaches have been urging swimmers to take care when in the water after a spate of horror dolphin attacks. Experts believe many of the randy ambushes could be linked back to Suzu the 8ft bottlenose dolphin. He has been blamed for 18 serious attacks in 2024 alone near the town of Mihama. With the worst assault leaving a primary school child needing at least 20 stitches on a deep bite mark in their finger. Another savage strike left a man without his fingertip. Suzu's sex pest work has been blowing concerned experts away since 2022 when he was said to have been responsible for at least 21 attacks. He has been accused of causing at least 48 injuries to men, women and children so far. With many victims saying they were dragged underwater and felt the beast rub up against them. Bruno Díaz López, the director of The Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute (BDRI), told The Sun this idea of dolphins being sexual towards humans is due to a few reasons. He said: ""Dolphins may engage in tactile behaviour that appears unusual to humans, but this is often a part of their normal social interactions rather than an expression of sexual intent. ""Male dolphins experience increased testosterone levels as they mature, which can result in behaviours that may seem sexual but are, in fact, part of social bonding. ""These interactions are often exploratory and are not necessarily an indication of intent to harm or distress."" Georgie Dolphin, an animal welfare campaigner from the Humane Society International in Australia, also revealed that the lethal attacks might not actually be a sign of aggression. She says Suzu and the other dolphins may be simply playing with the panicked victim and giving them a friendly gesture. Or they may feel threatened and launch defensive strikes to escape from the human. She told The Sun: ""Behaviours such as a wild dolphin biting a swimmer when humans are in their environment could have a multitude of causes. ""Gentle biting often occurs between male dolphins in the wild and is perceived as a friendly gesture. ""In some incidents when they exhibit this behaviour with humans, they may simply be defending themselves. ""Generally, the public perceive dolphins as a friendly and approachable species, but any wild animal can defend themselves or their young if they feel threatened."" Bruno added that dolphins are often deemed as being dangerous due to their size, strength and protective emotions compared to any human. FOR decades victims of dolphin attacks have revealed they were rubbed up against and pinned down by the sea creatures. This led to experts saying the animals were likely seen as hyper-sexual which goes some way to explaining how they attacks on humans. Sex is a natural act for dolphins with it often being done for pleasure rather than reproduction. They don't have a specific mating season like many other animals meaning they frequently take part in recreational sex. Another interesting element comes from their orientation with bottlenose's in particular being known for their fluid sexuality. They can often use sex as a way of marking out territory and asserting sexual dominance. Dr Chiara Giulia Bertulli, Sightings Officer at the Sea Watch Foundation, says: “Some can show tranquil behaviour – travelling, searching for food and socialising – but others can show much more aggressive behaviour, even within their own species. ""Many dolphins have tooth rakes on their skin from bouts of fighting. “Male dolphins in particular can show violence when fighting over new territories or dominance over the females."" Another reason for the dangerous blows dealt by dolphins such as Suzu may be due to his past relationships with humans. Georgie says meetings between people and wild dolphins are almost non-existent due to where the animals swim. So when a dolphin does encounter someone, especially near a crowded beach, it will easily cause them to become frightened and tense and lead to the unusual encounters. The dolphin expert from Australia also thinks Suzu's aggression towards humans could be a learnt behaviour. ""This particular dolphin may have experienced trauma caused by humans,"" she said. ""Given they are extremely intelligent mammals, they would be unlikely to forget such incidents."" Hormonal fluctuations, sexual frustration or the desire to dominate might drive the dolphin to injuring the people it interacts with Bottlenose's are believed to be able to retain information for up to 20 years making them one of the most memorable animals around. If Suzu, who appears to be a fully grown male, has had previous negative experiences with humans then this could factor into why he lashes out so often. Experts say they have spotted Suzu around the Fukui prefecture leading them to believe it is where he spends most of his time. Just across from the island sits the small town of Taiji, in Japan’s Wakayama prefecture which is infamous for its deadly dolphin drive hunts. Every year a bay in the town is used for the brutal butchering of hundreds of dolphins by herding the creatures to shore. Once they are captured they are either taken away to be sold as meat or transported to local aquariums and animal parks. Taiji is believed to be the only town in Japan that still allows for drive hunting on such a large scale. Several animal rights groups have condemned the decision to allow the annual culling to take place due to the large-scale terror it causes for the animals. Georgie believes Suzu's attitude towards humans could potentially be linked to the dolphin drive. One of the issues it may have caused is separating the dolphin from his pod. Dolphins are known as highly social animals who are often seen along with many friends in the ocean. But Suzu - and many other dolphins accused of attacking people - have only ever been seen alone. While dolphins may appear friendly and approachable, it’s important to remember that they are wild creatures, not pets or trained animals Dr Simon Allen, a biologist and principal investigator with the Shark Bay Dolphin Research project says this loneliness could be a driving factor into why incidents are taking place. He told the BBC: ""Bottlenose dolphins are highly social animals and this sociability can be expressed in very physical ways. ""Just as in humans and other social animals, hormonal fluctuations, sexual frustration or the desire to dominate might drive the dolphin to injuring the people it interacts with. ""Since they are such powerful animals, this can lead to serious injury in humans."" Many terrified locals have been calling for Suzu to be caught and put down for months with the attacks continuing to rise. Georgie has urged the public and local authorities to consider his situation rather than focusing solely on the damage caused. The animal welfare campaigner said: ""Keeping your distance and showing respect for wild animals is paramount.  ""Especially on any occasion when you enter their environment."" Bruno echoed Georgie's thoughts saying: ""While dolphins may appear friendly and approachable, it’s important to remember that they are wild creatures, not pets or trained animals."" THE dramatic rise in dolphin attacks across the past few years has left experts debating over the likely cause of this sharp rise. Biologists are constantly questioning what could trigger the animals such as Suzu and spark their irrational behaviour. One heartbreaking reason could be that the sex-crazed creatures are simply lonely. Dolphins tend to swim in groups, or pods, whereas some like Suzu are solo travellers. Some believe that dolphins will interact with humans in order to try and find a mate but will turn aggressive when aroused. Another reason for the randy tenancies could be an overexposure to humans, cetologist Professor Tadamichi Morisaka has argued. Divers often swim with dolphins they discover but when they leave the water the animals continue to want that playtime. This means they will approach people uninvited and may play too rough."
"How seven too-close-to-call regions and as little as 200,000 votes will decide the future of the world",We look at which way seven states may swing in the race for the most powerful job on the planet,"Grant Rollings, Feature WriterGrant Rollings, Feature Writer","21:02, 25 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","21:03, 25 Oct 2024","News,US News","WITH just ten days until the US chooses its next president, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are level in the polls – with just seven “swing” states set to decide the winner. In the US system instead of votes being counted nationally, the winner in each state is awarded a certain number of “electoral college” votes, partly based on the state’s population. There are 538 college votes in all, and the winner is the one who bags the most. Now the two rivals for the most powerful job on the planet are fighting hardest in the seven states where just a few thousand votes could make the difference. A Betfair spokesman said: “As things stand, Donald Trump is favourite to win in all but one of those seven key battlegrounds, and if the punters are right, he will win by a significant margin.” Today we look at which way those seven states may swing. TRUMP 47.3% | HARRIS 47.3% EVEN the bravest gambler in Las Vegas might hesitate to bet on who will win the state ­known for its casino city. Different polls have put either Harris or Trump ahead in Nevada, which has backed every ­Democrat candidate since 2008. The state has the highest unemployment rate in the US at 5.1 per cent and that could persuade enough undecided voters to pick the Republican. Campaigning in Nevada this week, Trump praised the state’s “amazing Filipinos”, some of who were at the rally. He told them: “It’s an honour to have you here. Beautiful clothing – the colours, I want to wear colours like that.” TRUMP 48.6% | HARRIS 46.8% WITH a 370-mile border with Mexico, the big issue in this southern state is illegal immigration. Trump has made up ground on Harris in the past couple of weeks in Arizona by relentlessly focusing on how unauthor-ised crossings hit record levels under Joe Biden. Harris tried to counter that by ­visiting a small border town and vowing to make the border between the US and Mexico more secure. Meanwhile security is being tightened ahead of voting after bullets were fired at the Democrats’ campaign office in Phoenix. TRUMP 47.6% | HARRIS 47.8% THIS week former US president Barack Obama was out campaigning for Harris in this state, which voted for the Democrat candidate in seven elections prior to Trump emerging victorious in 2016. On that occasion, his rival Hillary Clinton didn’t campaign hard enough in Wisconsin, but Harris is not making the same mistake. Trump, though, is hoping his message that immigrants are ­stealing jobs could see him get the northern state back after losing here to Biden in 2020. TRUMP 47% | HARRIS 47.7% THE state’s long- established car industry has been losing ground to foreign competitors for years. Another problem for Harris is that Michigan’s 400,000 Muslims are turning against the Democrats due to Biden’s support for Israel in its wars in Gaza and ­Lebanon. Many back Trump despite his friendship with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu. TRUMP 47.9% | HARRIS 47.6% THIS so-called “rust-belt” state in the North East of the US was won by Trump in 2016 and by Biden in 2020. At the moment it is too close to call, but surging inflation could dent Harris’s hopes in Pennsylvania, which last year saw the highest rise in the cost of grocery shopping anywhere in the country. Democrat candidate Harris was there on Wednesday trying to win over working-class voters in an area which is still trying to bounce back from decades of industrial decline. TRUMP 48.3% | HARRIS 47.1% TRUMP won this southern state by a margin of just 1.3 per cent in 2020 and polls suggest it could be even closer this time. At his first outdoor rally in North Carolina following his attempted assassination in July he said: “This state is a very, very big state to win.” Voters in the state who are still suffering from the ­aftermath of Hurricane Helene last month, which left 95 people dead and many without running water, could turn away from the Democrats. TRUMP 48.5% | HARRIS 47% AFTER losing the last Presidential election, Trump told Georgia’s ­Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find 11,780 votes” for him. That would have given him one more vote than Biden – but that attempt to influence a state official could still land the Republican candidate in court.  As for the 2024 election, two million of the state’s 11 million population have so far voted early. Most of the recent polls have Trump slightly ahead, but just a few thousand polling cards could make all the difference again on November 5."
Inside Joe Lycett’s very private love life as he welcomes his first child,And see what Joe says about his sexuality,"Fay Leyfield, Assistant Showbiz Editor (features)","19:46, 25 Oct 2024","21:57, 25 Oct 2024",TV,"JOE Lycett has surprised fans by revealing he has become a father for the first time. It’s thought the comedian, 36, welcomed his son with his secret girlfriend, who he calls Denise. The TV star has famously kept his romances underwraps over the years, but just recently shed a little light on the mystery woman in his life. Speaking on Bimini Bon-Boulash’s podcast The Pieces, Joe revealed: “So I’ve got Winston the cat, and my partner Denise. And, um, she’s not called Denise, but I don’t talk about her, because she has a job that she can’t be in the public eye. “I call her Denise because she hates the name Denise, so, uh, I live with Denise.” Joe first revealed he had found love when his popular TV show Late Night Lycett return to telly in April for a new series. Opening the show, he said: ""A lot has changed since the last series, I've got some news which is that I have a girlfriend. ""I've talked about being bisexual for years but people presume I'm homosexual based on my entire personality...yes I've got a girlfriend and people have been very nice about it."" On the podcast, he revealed that people are often surprised he is with a woman, as he opened up about being pansexual. He explained: “Well, it’s interesting now being in a long-term relationship with a woman because loads of people are like, sorry what? There was a brief period when I was at school when I thought because I was attracted to men, I was gay, and then I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on.’ “Then I use the term bisexual when anyone asks and I just want to give a quick answer because people understand that. “But I think the most accurate way of describing myself is pansexual, in that I’m not attracted to people, just because of their gender. He continued : ""Yeah, it doesn’t matter what the gender or whatever.  And I don’t know why that is, but that is how it is. It’s a strange one because to me that suggests that sexuality is not just man, woman.’   ""So the intellectual side of me goes it’s pansexual, which means all. So, that’s how I feel about myself."" He added: ""And I don’t really care what anyone else thinks about it these days, because I just think it’s nothing to do with you."" The star went on to reveal how he feels about people assuming he’s gay, explaining:  ""But I do think it’s interesting. A few years into a relationship with a woman and going like, I am a straight man now, that dresses like this. ""I am still struggling with it in different ways of course. And particularly because lots of people just presume I’m gay because I’m camp on telly."" The word comes from the Greek prefix ""pan"", which means “all”. Its first use has been traced back to neurologist Sigmund Freud, who defined it as: “the pervasion of all conduct and experience with sexual emotions"". In simpler terms, pansexuality is a person's attraction to people regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Pansexuals are ""gender blind"", meaning they don't let gender or sex affect their attraction to others. Just like bisexuality, pansexuals are sexually attracted to men and women. But the key difference is that pansexual people tend to consider themselves as more “gender fluid”. They may also be drawn to those who identify as intersex, third-gender, androgynous or transgender."

Sir Keir Starmer said the increased visible presence of vessels is vital to British security. His intervention, to protect maritime routes and Pacific economies, comes after a foreign policy review last year identified China as an “epoch-defining challenge”. The PM, meeting Commonwealth leaders in Samoa, said: “As responsible international players, we cannot turn a blind eye to the challenges faced by our friends and partners on the other side of the world. ""So my message today is clear: this is just the beginning of our commitment to the Indo-Pacific. “I truly believe we can create unique opportunities for people both in the Pacific and at home, and in doing so, we play our part in ensuring a safer, fairer world.” The UK has two patrol vessels permanently in the region — HMS Spey and HMS Tamar.

‘I thought Christmas was ruined’ say relieved shoppers as iconic fizzy drink brand reveals it WON’T be axed,It follows a mysterious marketing compaign,Amelia StoutAmelia Stout,"0:34, 26 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","0:34, 26 Oct 2024","Money,News Money","SHOPPERS have breathed a sigh of relief after a beloved drinks brand confirmed it won't be axing its iconic fizzy drink. Some had even been worrying that this year's Christmas would be ruined if the beverage were discontinued. Fans of Old Jamaica ginger beer had been speculating for a while that the sun had set on the refreshing drink. This was after a cryptic announcement by the brand claiming it would be ""retiring"" in a ""blaze of glory"". But this week, on October 24, it put rumours to bed in an Instagram post, with one commenter quickly quipping: ""You rotters! I thought my Xmas was gonna be ruined."" The Instagram video began with the caption: ""Did anyone actually think we were signing off?” It added: “We’re not f***ing leaving. It’s our iconic look we are bidding farewell to. ""Time for a well deserved refresh. Stay tuned."" Before this much-awaited update, customers flooded Reddit to discuss the potential axing. One dramatically wrote: ""I swear to God I will not survive without this sweet fiery nectar."" Another concerned fan said: ""Hell no !!! its goes great with pretty much every drink alcoholic."" Sensing a marketing ploy, a third said: ""If they've changed their name to New Jamaica I'm going to be fuming."" The Caribbean-inspired brand was launched in Kington, London, in 1927 and is owned by Beliv Company. It comes as a number of other companies have announced new or rebranded products ahead of Christmas. Aldi baffled shoppers with a new product that seemed more Easter-appropriate than it did Christmassy - hollow chocolate eggs named ""Garry the Gingerbread Man"" and ""Parker the Penguin"". Meanwhile, M&S shoppers rushed to grab a new £15 gift box of chocolates that ""snows"" when you shake it. A RANGE of classic products are being revived this Christmas after previously being axed. Aldi's Chocolate Mountain Bar ALDI shoppers have been left overjoyed after the supermarket's iconic Toblerone dupe returned to shelves. Fans of the bargain retailer have been pleading for the Specially Selected Swiss chocolate bar to make a comeback, with Aldi finally giving in. The blonde bar is seen as a family favourite with happy customers describing it as ""lush"" as they race into stores to grab one. Each 100g pack cost is now priced at £1.69. Each bar is packed with delicious ingredients from white chocolate, honey, almond, nougat and salted caramel pieces. Mars' Marathon Bars Mars announced it was bringing back the iconic Marathon chocolate bar after it was rebranded 34 years ago. The bar was re-titled as Snickers in 1990 and lost its iconic name but will return to supermarket shelves for a limited time this year. The limited-edition wrappers will be available exclusively at Morrisons until December, which means you’ll only have a few months to enjoy the blast from the past. Starbucks' Toffee Nut Latte Starbucks fans are going wild as a £1.50 buy has landed back in stores - and if you’re a lover of the coffee chain’s Christmas drinks, then prepare to be overjoyed. One savvy shopper was left beaming when browsing in her local Sainsbury’s, when she noticed that toffee nut latte sachets were now available to buy. So if you’re obsessed with the Starbucks Christmas beverage, which normally hits stores at the start of November and is available until the end of the year, and want to be able to have it all year round, you’ll need to head to Sainsbury’s and stock up. Cadbury's Dairy Milk Winter Mint Crisp The confectionery giant has brought back its Dairy Milk Mint Crisp bar for shoppers to enjoy as the nights draw in. It forms part of the sweet makers' new Christmas range which also includes a retro selection box. Cadbury's confirmed earlier this year that the minty treat had been axed from shelves and it had ""no plans to reintroduce it"". It came after nostalgic shoppers made calls for Cadbury's to bring back the retro snack. Its Winter Mint Crisp bar has already landed on shelves, with Tesco charging £4.50 for a 360g bar. You can get it for just £4 if you have a Tesco Clubcard. It is also on offer at supermarket Asda for £4."
