Progressives upset Kamala Harris is campaigning with Liz Cheney: Report,"'Don't take the progressive movement for granted,' a director of a progressive group told the AP",Hanna Panreck,"October 26, 2024 2:20pm EDT",Media,"CNN host Jake Tapper pressed Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday about why Kamala Harris was campaigning with Liz Cheney, a Republican, and not him. Some progressive Democrats are upset with Vice President Kamala Harris' decision to lean on Liz Cheney in the weeks ahead of the election, suggesting the vice president should focus more on her Democratic base. ""The truth of the matter is that there are a hell of a lot more working-class people who could vote for Kamala Harris than there are conservative Republicans,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT., told the Associated Press. Cheney, an anti-Trump Republican, has appeared on the campaign trail with Harris several times. Other progressive leaders, such as Sanders or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have been ""relegated to low-profile roles,"" according to the AP. ""She has to start talking more to the needs of working-class people,"" Sanders told the AP. ""I wish this had taken place two months ago. It is what it is."" CNN's Jake Tapper asked Bernie Sanders on Sunday why VP Kamala Harris was campaigning with Liz Cheney and not him. (Screenshot/CNN) ""There’s been an odd disconnect between the campaign’s economic populist ad strategy and the event strategy that focuses almost exclusively on Liz Cheney kumbaya optics that depress the base right as voting begins and don’t provably win more swing voters than bread-and-butter issues,"" Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, told the AP. However, Green praised the Harris campaign for focusing their ads on grocery prices and economics. Joseph Geevarghese, the executive director of the progressive group Our Revolution, told the AP that 10% of progressives might not vote for Harris and warned some might vote for Trump. ""We just want to raise a red flag. Don’t take the progressive movement for granted,"" Geevarghese said. ""There’s got to be an economic argument at the end of the day. That’s the No. 1 thing that matters to voters.""

""What does it say that Kamala Harris is starting this week with only 16 days left, campaigning with Liz Cheney, a very conservative former congresswoman, daughter of Dick Cheney, obviously, but she has not yet held a public campaign event with you, arguably the leader of the progressive movement in the United States?"" Tapper asked. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sanders said that it had to do with ""people really disgusted with Trump’s constant lying with his attempt to prevent the first peaceful transition of power"" and his ""undermining of American democracy."" Sanders has campaigned for Harris but has not appeared with the vice president on the trail. The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

Trump appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast for nearly three hours: Here are the top moments,Trump tapes 'The Joe Rogan Experience' podcast,Danielle Wallace,"October 26, 2024 7:45am EDT October 26, 2024 2:08pm EDT",Donald Trump,"Former President Donald Trump explains how he settled conflict with North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. Former President Trump taped ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast for nearly three hours on Friday. The podcast, recorded in Austin, Texas, afforded the Republican presidential nominee exposure to Rogan's 14.5 million followers on Spotify and 17.6 million followers on YouTube. Rogan, the nation's most-listened-to podcast host, is extremely influential with young male voters, who Trump is aiming to reach. Here are the top takeaways from the podcast that aired on Friday. Trump told Rogan that he regretted some of the appointments he made in his first-term. ""The one question that you'll ask me that I think you'll ask me that people seem to ask -- and I always come up with the same answer – if I, the one mistake because I had a lot of success, great economy, great everyth, everything was great with the military rebuilt the biggest tax cuts in history, all the stuff we did, we had a great presidency,"" Trump said. ""Three Supreme Court justices. Most people get none. You know, you pick them young this way. They're there for 50 years. Right. So, you know, even if a president is there for eight years, oftentimes they never have a chance. I had three. It was the luck of the draw.""""But I will say that it always comes back to the same answer,"" Trump said. ""The biggest mistake I made was I picked some people, I picked some great people, you know, but you don't think about that. I picked some people that I shouldn't have picked. I picked a few people that I shouldn't have picked."" ""And neocons,"" Rogan said. ""Yeah, neocons or bad people or disloyal people,"" Trump said. While explaining the process of choosing political nominations once he got into office, Trump discussed his initial appointment of John Bolton, who served as White House National Security adviser. In 2019, Trump fired Bolton, who remains a staunch critic. Trump described how Phil Ruffin, a fellow American businessman, warned him that Bolton was a ""bad guy,"" but by then, Trump had already hired him. Podcast host Joe Rogan told former President Trump he has gotten so popular with Americans due to the ""wild s---"" he says.  (The Joe Rogan Experience) ""And he was right. But he was good in a certain way. He's a nut job. And every time I had to deal with a country when they saw this whack job standing behind me, they said, 'Man, Trump's going to go to war with us.' He was with Bush when they went stupidly into the Middle East. They should have never done it. I used to say it as a civilian, so I always got more publicity than other people,"" Trump said. ""It wasn't like I was trying,"" Trump said. ""In fact, I don't know exactly why. Maybe you can tell me."" ""I could definitely tell you,"" Rogan offered. ""You said a lot of wild s---. … And then CNN in all their brilliance by highlighting your wild s--- made you much more popular. And they boost you in the polls because people were tired of someone talking in this bulls--- pre-prepared politician lingo. And even if they didn't agree with you, they at least knew whoever that guy is, that's him. That's really him."" ""The rebels are Republicans now, though, like you want to be invisible, you want to be punk rock, you want to like, buck the system? You're a conservative now,"" Rogan said. ""That's how crazy. And then the liberals are now pro-silencing criticism. They're pro-censorship online. … [T]hey come in regulating free speech and now regulating the First Amendment. It's bananas to watch."" Elon Musk, who took over Twitter — now X — in 2022, responded to the clip, writing, ""Exactly."" ""You know they come after their political opponent,"" Trump told Rogan in response. ""I've been investigated more than Alfonse Capone."" In his meeting with former President Obama during the presidential transition period, Trump recalled, ""Obama thought we were going to go to war with North Korea."" Rogan then referenced how Trump dubbed North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un ""Little Rocket Man"" early on in his first term. ""I said, 'Little Rocket Man, you're going to burn in hell.' And it was rough,"" Trump said. ""I got to know him better than anybody, anybody. And I said, 'Do you ever do anything else? Why don't you go take it easy and relax? Go to the beach?' You know, kiddingly, I said, 'You're always building nuclear. Just relax. You don't have to do it. Let's build some condos.'"" Rogan praised Trump for partnering with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to ""Make America Healthy Again"" and asked the Republican presidential nominee if he would completely commit to having Kennedy, a former independent presidential candidate, as part of his administration. ""Oh, I am, but the only thing I want to be a little careful about with him is the environmental. Because, you know, he doesn't like oil. I love oil,"" Trump said. ""I think just keep him out of the fire. So I'm going to keep him out of a little bit. I said focus on health. Focus. You could do whatever you want, but, I got to be a little bit careful with the liquid gold."" Rogan, showing Trump charts, referenced how ""there are chemicals and ingredients in our food that are illegal in other countries because they've been shown to be toxic."" ""There's pesticides and herbicides, and there's a lot of sh-- that's been sprayed on our food that really is unnecessary,"" the podcaster said. ""And there's a lot of health consequences."" Rogan added that Kennedy recently told him that ""more than 70% of young men are ineligible for the military because of their health."" ""But RFK is going to be – you know I think he's a great guy,"" Trump said. Rogan also asked if Trump faced pressure not to work with Kennedy. JOE ROGAN TELLS TRUMP THE 'WILD S---' HE SAYS FUELED HIS POPULARITY DURING THREE HOUR PODCAST INTERVIEW""But I would say that the Big Pharma wasn't thrilled when they heard that,"" Trump said. ""I've actually always gotten along very well with him. I've known him a long time. He's a different kind of a guy. He's very smart, great guy, and he's very sincere about this. I mean, he really is. You know, he thinks we spend a fortune on pesticides and all this stuff, and then you end up at that chart is a terrible shot."" Rogan and Trump discussed the botched Afghanistan withdrawal under the Biden-Harris administration. In addition to the 13 U.S. service members killed in a suicide bombing at Kabul airport, Rogan referenced how the United States left behind billions of dollars worth of equipment now seen in Taliban military parades. Trump said President Biden should have fired everyone involved in planning the withdrawal, taking issue with retired Gen. Mark Milley, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Trump and Biden. Trump said U.S. troops should have left last from Bagram Air Base because it's located ""one hour away from where China makes its nuclear missiles"" and should have taken all their equipment with them. ""Every plane, every screw  should have been taken out, every tent. And I said that. That's when I realized that Milley was a dummy. I said, 'we're leaving, but I want to get everything out,'"" Trump said. ""'Sir, it's cheaper to leave it,'"" Trump said Milley told him. ""It's cheaper to leave it?"" Rogan asked. ""Yeah, he said it's cheaper to leave it,"" Trump affirmed. ""Cheaper?"" Rogan asked again. ""Not more dangerous?"" ""He just said cheaper,"" Trump said. ""I said ‘I want every plane, I want every tank, I want the goggles, said night goggles. They have all this stuff that these guys now have.’ He said, 'sir, it's cheaper to get out and leave it.' I said, so you think it's cheaper to leave $150 million brand new airplane in there than it is to fly it out with a tank of jet fuel and put it in Pakistan, or just fly it directly back?"" ""'It's cheaper to leave it.' I said, 'this guy's nuts,'"" Trump added. ""I'm telling you, he was so stupid. He was so unwise. He was like an unwise man. And there were a number of them."" Trump also recalled how he spoke with Taliban’s chief negotiator Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. ""I had a couple of conversations with Abdul, and from the time I had those conversations, because they were shooting our soldiers, you know, with the sniper stuff,"" Trump said. ""They were shooting a lot with Obama, much less with me. But they were shooting them. And I said, get this guy on the phone. The press went nuts when they heard this. I had a great conversation – It was a tough conversation. 18 months later, there wasn't one soldier that was ever shot at, and even Biden admitted it in a moment of stupidity."" Trump spoke of efforts to have cars made in the United States, specifically to revitalize the once booming industry in Detroit, Michigan. Recently, Trump threatened a large auto plant ""being built by China in Mexico"" that he would implement 100 or 200% tariffs on every car made there if he wins, so ""they'll be unsaleable in the United States."" In response, the plant reportedly announced it would stop production. ""This was the biggest plant in the world. It would have more than all of Michigan makes. That's how big,"" Trump said. ""You know, this is what we're getting to. And I said, if that plant goes up, I want them to understand if I win, I'm going to tax those cars at the rate of 100 or 200% apiece so that you won't be able to sell them in the United States. They just announced they're not going to build the plant."" ""I did a big favor for our country by doing that. And I'm not even there yet. To me, the most beautiful word, I've said this for the last couple of weeks in the dictionary today is the word tariff,"" Trump continued. ""It's more beautiful than love, more beautiful than anything. It's the most beautiful word. This country can become rich with the use, the proper use of tariffs."" ""Did you just float out the idea of getting rid of income taxes and replacing it with tariffs?"" Rogan interjected. ""Were you serious about that?"" ""Yeah, sure. Why not?"" Trump said. ""Our country was the richest, relatively in the 1880s and 1890s. A president who was assassinated, named McKinley, he was the tariff king."" ""He spoke beautifully of terrorists. His language was really beautiful. ‘We will not allow the enemy to come in and take our jobs and take our factories and take our workers and take our families unless they pay a big price. And the big price is tariffs.’ And he'd speak like that. But he was right,"" Trump said. ""And then around in the early 1900s, they switched over stupidly to, frankly, an income tax."" Trump said he has interviewed jet pilots who described seeing what looked like a ball that traveled four times faster than an F-22 plane, opening the conversation up to the subject of UFOs. ""It's not a great interest for me, but it's a little interest. I get that question as much as almost any question. Do you think that we have aliens coming, you know, flying around or whatever?"" Trump said. ""I mean, there's no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don't have life, you know?"" Trump described Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Karris as a ""very low IQ person,"" when Rogan asked him about how Harris compared her Republican opponent to Adolf Hitler. ""There's the rhetoric is also that you're Hitler and that in order to stop Hitler, you have to do whatever,"" Rogan said. ""I mean, you're hearing this now, Kamala compared you, said you love Hitler yesterday."" ""Kamala is a very low IQ person. She's a very low IQ. You know, I'm for taking tests too. I think anybody that runs for president should take, they should give them a test,"" Trump said. ""And it's not an age thing,"" Trump said. ""If you look back on history, 70s and 80s, your greatest, some of your greatest leaders in the world, world history, long time world history, they were in their 70s, in their 80s. But I think you should take cognitive tests. I think everybody – they say it's unconstitutional, but I think that's ridiculous. I think Kamala should have a test because there's something missing. There's something wrong with her."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Well, I think it's pressure,"" Rogan said. ""I think the pressure and the scrutiny. You've been a celebrity for a long time, and you understand what this is like. But for someone who's in her late 40s, who becomes the vice president, who runs for president, becomes a vice president, and then all of a sudden, the weight of the world is on your shoulders. And there's all these people, a lot of people clam up."" ""But you either have it or you don't,"" Trump said. Rogan agreed, ""Correct."" From the official vice presidential residence at the White House on Wednesday, Harris accepted the claim of former Trump White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, who said Trump wanted ""Hitler's generals."" Harris said her GOP opponent is ""unhinged"" and seeks ""unchecked power."" Rogan acknowledged how the Republican presidential nominee appeared on his friend and fellow comedian Theo Von's ""This Past Weekend"" podcast in August. ""Is that why you called me to do this?"" Trump asked. ""No, no,"" Rogan said. ""Once they shot you, I was like, he's got to come in here. It's all about timing. I think our timing is perfect… Do you even have a scar on your ear? You got anything on there?"" ""I do,"" Trump said, ""so right over here."" ""Oh, it's a tiny mark,"" Rogan said. ""It zinged right there,"" Trump said, motioning to the side of his ear. ""It healed up pretty f---ing good,"" Rogan offered. ""Yeah, it's pretty good. Yeah, it's a little... It's not like some of the wrestlers, some of the UFC fighters,"" Trump said. ""It was sort of like a top shot.. but it makes me a tougher guy."" Danielle Wallace is a breaking news and politics reporter at Fox News Digital.

Two major national polls conducted Sunday through Wednesday and released Friday indicate Harris and Trump in a dead heat. Former President Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, laughs after speaking during a campaign rally Thursday in Las Vegas. (AP/Alex Brandon) Grabbing headlines first is a New York Times/Siena College survey indicating the Democratic Party and GOP presidential nominees are tied at 48%. That's a switch from a previous poll, earlier this month, when Harris held a slight three-point edge. A CNN survey had the candidates deadlocked at 47% among likely voters nationwide. Its previous poll from late September indicated the vice president had a razor-thin one-point margin. There were warning signs in the two surveys for both candidates, however. Harris lost her favorability advantage over Trump in both polls. After replacing President Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in July, the vice president's favorable ratings soared. But they've steadily eroded over the past month. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, speaks during a campaign event at Riverside Park in Grand Rapids, Mich., Oct. 18. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Another red flag for Harris are polls indicating her support among Black voters is below Biden's levels in the 2020 election. For Trump, his support among White voters is on par with his standing in the 2020 election, when he lost the White House to Biden. And the former president still faces a healthy deficit to the vice president when it comes to being trustworthy and caring about people. While national polls are closely watched, the race for the White House is not based on the national popular vote. It's a battle for the states and their electoral votes. FROM ‘JOYFUL WARRIOR’ TO CALLING TRUMP A ‘FACIST,’ KAMALA HARRIS CHANGES HER MESSAGING IN THE FINAL STRETCH And the latest surveys in the seven crucial battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump and will likely determine whether Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election, are mostly within the margin of error. The latest Fox News national poll indicated Trump had a two-point edge, but Harris had a 6-point advantage among respondents questioned in all seven battleground states. Former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris (Fox News) While there's a margin of error in the polls, there is a clear frontrunner in the battle for campaign cash, another important indicator in presidential politics. And it's Harris. According to the latest figures the two major party presidential campaigns filed with the Federal Election Commission, Harris hauled in $97 million during the first half of October. That far outpaced the $16 million the Trump campaign said it raised during the first half of this month. Both campaigns use a number of affiliated fundraisings committees to raise money. And when those are included, Trump narrowed the gap, but trailed $176 million to $97 million during the first two weeks of this month. The new filings also spotlight that the Harris campaign continues to vastly outspend the Trump campaign. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP During the first 16 days of October, the Democratic presidential nominee's campaign outspent Trump $166 million to $99 million, with paid media the top expenditure for both campaigns. However, Harris finished the reporting period with more cash in her coffers. As of Oct. 16, she had $119 million cash on hand, while Trump had $36 million. When joint fundraising committees are also included, Harris holds a $240 million to $168 million cash-on-hand advantage.

JERUSALEM—After Israel’s daring aerial military strikes in Iran early Saturday, the Jewish state announced that it is prepared to continue to go on the ""offense"" against the world’s worst state-sponsor of terrorism, the Islamic Republic of Iran, if Tehran responds. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said, ""If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation - we will be obligated to respond. Our message is clear: All those who threaten the State of Israel and seek to drag the region into a wider escalation — will pay a heavy price."" He added, ""We demonstrated today that we have both the capability and the resolve to act decisively — and we are prepared — on offense and defense — to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel."" US MADE AWARE OF ISRAEL'S STRIKE ON IRAN DAYS IN ADVANCE; IDF SAYS MISSION COMPLETE Iranian air defense reportedly operating as Israel began striking Iranian targets in Tehran. (Obtained by Fox News) Israel dubbed its Saturday mission ""Days of Repentance"" as a response to Iran’s launch of its barrage of around 200 ballistic missiles on October 1 into the Holy Land. Iran said it attacked Israel as retaliation for the IDF’s elimination of the Tehran-backed global Hezbollah terrorist, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut. Pressure on Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from the Biden-Harris administration seems to have paid off on Jerusalem limiting its historic attack on Iran to purely military installations. Israel avoided knocking out Iran’s illicit nuclear weapons sites and its vast oil production enterprises. ""Israel opted for the least-aggressive response against the Islamic Republic by conducting precise strikes on military targets,"" noted Lisa Daftari, an Iran expert and editor-in-chief of The Foreign Desk. Daftari told Fox News Digita, ""This approach raises questions about whether the U.S. influenced Israel to adopt a more restrained response, possibly to prevent further escalation. One could argue these strikes successfully reestablished deterrence, while it can also be said that Israel missed an opportunity to target more crucial sites. Many factors, including the timing, target selection, and strike intensity, were complicated by a U.S. leak and our upcoming elections. Despite these pressures, Israel appears prepared to change its approach if the Islamic Republic decides to escalate further."" Israeli Air Force planes departing for the strikes in Iran last night. (IDF Spokesman's Unit) On Saturday, Secretary of Defense Austin issued a statement on X noting that he had spoken with his Israeli counterpart where he ""reaffirmed the ironclad commitment of the United States to Israel’s security and right to self-defense. I made it clear that the United States maintains an enhanced force posture to defend U.S. personnel, Israel, and partners across the region in the face of threats from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist organizations and is determined to prevent any actor from exploiting tensions or expanding the conflict in the region."" A senior U.S. official said on Friday that ""Israel conducted precision airstrikes against multiple military targets across Iran and outside populated areas."" The official added that the United States played no role in the mission and the ""President and his national security team, of course, worked with the Israelis over recent weeks to encourage Israel to conduct it, to conduct a response that was targeted and proportional. A lower risk of civilian harm. And that appears to have been precisely what transpired this evening."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his telephone call with President Biden earlier this month, where Israel's response to Iran was reportedly discussed. (Israeli Prime Minister's Office) Mardo Soghom, the Chief Editor of Iran International English website, told Fox News Digital, ""The regime and its media are downplaying the attack. They are saying it was ineffective, and the air defenses are wonderful. They claim Israel's attack had minimal damage. Some of the regime’s hardliners are openly urging a counter-attack. Iran’s foreign ministry is saying its right of response is still reserved."" ISRAEL BEGINS RETALIATORY STRIKES AGAINST IRAN FOLLOWING MISSILE BARRAGE TARGETING ISRAELIS He chalked up the foreign ministry response to cliché-like diplomatic language and noted that ""No one witnessed the S-300"" air defense system being fired, suggesting that Israel’s bypassed Iran’s vaunted Russian-made counter-missile apparatus.

The U.S. has warned Iran not to respond, so if Iran responds, it could warrant a U.S. response,"" said the Iran expert Soghom. Israeli counterstrikes reportedly killed four Iranian soldiers, one of whom was an officer, according to the regime-controlled media. It is unclear whether Tehran will up the ante and launch new missile attacks against the Jewish state.

In the largest attack by Israel on Iran in history, Jerusalem on Friday launched a wave of retaliatory airstrikes against Iran after the Islamic Republic fired a barrage of missiles toward Israelis earlier this month. Local Israeli news outlet Channel 12 reported that in a direct attack on Iran, Israel sent 140 Air Force planes to the skies for the assault that has reportedly targeted military facilities containing missile exports, drones, ballistic missile transmitters and Iran's air defense systems. The local outlet further reported that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps headquarters in Tehran was hit by strikes, though Fox News has not been able to independently verify this. Explosions were first heard near Iran's capital of Tehran and nearby Karaj, Reuters said, citing local media. ""In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel – right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran,"" the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. ""The regime in Iran and its proxies in the region have been relentlessly attacking Israel since October 7th – on seven fronts – including direct attacks from Iranian soil. Like every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and the duty to respond. Our defensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilized. We will do whatever necessary to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel.""

The Iranian news agency further reported the ""situation in the capital is normal, including at Imam Khomeini (RA) and Mehrabad airports.""

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR: RESPONSE TO IRAN WILL BE ‘VERY PAINFUL’ Iranian air defense reportedly operating as Israel began striking Iranian targets in Tehran. (Obtained by Fox News) The Israeli military action comes after Defense Minister Yoav Gallant vowed a ""precise and deadly"" response to the more than 180 missiles Iran targeted Israel with on Oct. 1, some of which were intercepted with the help of the U.S. Last week, during the leadup to the Israeli attack, reports emerged that the Israeli Defense Forces presented a list of potential targets to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Gallant as officials conducted ""sensitive coordination"" with other countries in the Middle East. ""The regime is vulnerable, and it's up to us to decide which message we want to send to them,"" Israeli ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon also told Fox News Digital. ""It will be very painful for the Iranian regime, and they will think twice in the future whether to attack Israel or not."" Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the barrage of missiles it fired at Israel on Oct. 1 was in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike and the killing of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July. Israel later eliminated Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in a military operation in the Gaza Strip on Oct. 16. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has previously called Nasrallah ""the flag-bearer of resistance"" in the region. ""The blood of the martyr shall not go unavenged,"" Khamenei said following Nasrallah’s death, according to Reuters.

(Photo by Drew ANGERER / AFP) (Photo by DREW ANGERER/AFP via Getty Images)  Former President Trump received a massive endorsement of major Muslim leaders and Imams of Michigan, which he announced during a rally on Saturday. “Muslims are joining our cause in larger numbers than ever before, and now the most wonderful thing is happening, we’re winning overwhelming support from the Muslim and Arab voters right here in Michigan, can you believe it?” he said. “It’s great. And earlier today, I had an incredible meeting, a great meeting. You know what they want? They want peace, they’re great people, with a group of Muslim imams. And like everyone here today, Muslim and Arabic voters in Michigan — you know, they’re going to be, they could turn the election one way or the other I think.” He then brought a group of Muslim and Arab leaders, as well as imams, on stage, one of whom said, “We as Muslims stand with President Trump, because he promises peace – not war.” The Trump campaign announced the endorsement on X. “President Trump was just endorsed by Imam Belal Alzuhairi and other prominent leaders of Michigan's Muslim community — the most expansive, diverse coalition in political history,” the campaign wrote.   Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Vice President Kamala Harris is ""desperate"" since she is now calling her opponent former President Trump a ""fascist"" in the closing days of the 2024 campaign.

""This is different than any other election. There have been two assassination attempts.

""None. Absolutely none. I don’t want one. I don’t wanna work for the government,"" Cuban said, noting that he has a company of his own that is already ""killing it"" and ""changing health care."" ""That’s one of the great things about Kamala Harris. You heard her talk about PBM’s pharmacy benefit middle men, really taking a hammer to them, you’ve seen her talk about transparency which will reduce cost of medications for families and households for 20-30% or more. You know, I think I could have more of an impact on healthcare in general with CostPlusDrugs.com and just doing what I do as an entrepreneur as opposed to working for the government."" Cavuto noted that there has been talk about Elon Musk taking a role in a potential Trump administration as the ""cost cutter"" secretary, but Cuban thought otherwise. ""Yeah but look, even Elon’s gotta – to me I would follow the law and say if I wanted a cabinet position, which I don't, I would have to divest everything I’m doing, and I don’t want to do that. I don’t see how Elon actually has a cabinet position or a real position inside an administration because of all the conflicts of interest that he would have. I mean, I don’t see how that works.""

 New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie argued with the liberal hosts of ABC's ""The View"" on Friday's show after he insisted that Vice President Harris still had more work to do to convince voters to support her. There are just 11 days until Election Day. Christie suggested that undecided voters still didn't ""know"" Harris and that she had failed to distinguish herself from President Biden and his policies. ""Ten days ago I would've told you that she's going to win. And I think she's had a bad ten days,"" he began. ""There’s advantages and disadvantages to coming into the race this late. The advantage is she didn’t have to go through all the primaries and go through all of that that goes on that wears you down a bit. But the disadvantage is people don’t know her,"" he said. ""She's been vice president for four years!"" co-host Sunny Hostin cut in. ""How could they not know her?"" Christie defended his comment by saying that the job of vice-president keeps you out of ""focus"" from the public, before co-host Joy Behar also interrupted. ""Why do they keep accusing her of doing nothing when she was vice president?"" Behar exclaimed. ""What did Mike Pence do?"" Christie went on to say that Harris needs to make clear to voters what she would do differently from President Biden, after she's struggled to answer this question in multiple interviews. This is an excerpt from an article by Kristine Parks.   Latino voters – a longstanding Democratic voting bloc – appear more likely to cast their ballot for former President Trump than Vice President Harris this election cycle, a recent poll shows. A new USA Today/Suffolk University poll taken among Latinos between October 14-18 saw Trump boasting an 11-point lead at 49% compared to Harris' 38% with a +/-9% margin of error. Despite Latino voters trending toward Democratic candidates in the past, Goya Foods CEO Bob Unanue isn't surprised. ""We are the No. 1 exploited community in the world,"" he told Fox News on Tuesday. ""The biggest industry that has flourished under this administration, under Kamala, has been drugs and human trafficking. Last year, Tara Lee Rodas testified that the U.S. is the middleman in this hundreds of billion-dollar business. She said there were 85,000 children missing…"" ""From 85,000, this year, they raised the amount of children lost or sold to 325,000 children. The Hispanic community, the Latino community is fed up with being exploited. They're fed up with high prices, and that's why you're seeing this community go head over heels toward Donald J. Trump."" Unanue, who leads America's largest Hispanic-owned food company that produces and distributes items in the U.S. as well as Spanish-speaking countries, has been critical of the Biden-Harris administration on multiple occasions — slamming their job performance on the economy and immigration, two prevailing issues this election cycle. This is an excerpt from an article by Taylor Penley.   Republican political analyst Ford O’Connell said recent decisions by major newspapers to refrain from endorsing presidential candidates, including the liberal-leaning Washington Post, show the race is ""slipping away"" from Vice President Kamala Harris. ""Trump is firing on all cylinders and he's outworking Kamala Harris at every turn on the campaign trail,"" O'Connell said on ""Fox & Friends Weekend."" ""And frankly, he's going up in all the polls,"" O'Connell added. The GOP strategist pointed out that Trump is leading in the Real Clear Politics average of polls in all seven key battleground states, with his strongest polling in sun belt states including North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona. ""Obviously, he's going to have to pick off one of the blue wall states, whether it's Pennsylvania, Michigan or Wisconsin. Right now, it appears that Harris is leading in the early vote in Pennsylvania. But let me tell you, it's going to be really, really close in all three of those states. But I do think the momentum is on Trump's side.""   Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) CEO Dana White are just some of the names expected to speak at former President Trump’s much-anticipated rally at New York City’s Madison Square Garden (MSG) on Sunday. ""The World's Most Famous Arena"" is expected to be packed with Trump supporters as the Republican nominee returns to his ""deep blue"" home state as his campaign enters its final days with increasing momentum. MSG is a 19,500-seat venue. The Trump campaign says the program includes political icons, celebrities, musical artists, and friends and family of former President Trump who will all discuss how he is ""the best choice to fix everything that Kamala Harris broke."" ""This epic event, in the heart of President Trump's home city, will be a showcase of the historic political movement that President Trump has built in the final days of the campaign,"" the campaign said in a press release. Musk has already hit the campaign trail for Trump, delivering a memorable speech in Butler, Pennsylvania, earlier this month, when the former president returned to the same site where an assassination attempt was made on his life on July 13. White, who has been a close friend of Trump for years and played a role in him reestablishing the mixed martial arts company in the early 2000s, introduced the former president at this year’s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, telling the crowd the stakes have never been higher. Other notable attendees this Sunday include former Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, political commentator Tucker Carlson and former Democrat presidential nominee turned Republican Tulsi Gabbard. High-profile names from the political world include Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance, Speaker Mike Johnson, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. Republican National Committee Co-Chair Lara Trump as well as the former president’s sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. will also feature. From the music world, Death Row Records founder Michael Harris Jr. is set to appear, as will singer Lee Greenwood and opera singer Christopher Macchio. This is an excerpt from an article by Michael Dorgan.   The Harris-Walz campaign rolled out a new TV and digital ad on Saturday linking former President Trump to the internment of Japanese Americans
 during World War II and other acts of anti-Asian hate. In the 30-second ad, titled, ""Our America,"" the Harris campaign accuses Trump of having an ""outdated vision of America"" that ""has no place"" for Asian Americans. The ad features symbols of American freedom, including the Constitution, purportedly ""under attack by Trump and his extremist allies,"" the Harris campaign said in a news release. The ad ""alludes to moments when Asian Americans were denied their civil rights – such as the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II and the 1982 murder of Vincent Chin in Detroit,"" the campaign said. It concludes with a call to action to defend democracy by voting for Harris. “The choice for Asian American voters in this election couldn’t be clearer. While Trump surrounds himself with loyalists to emulate the dictators he admires and intends to wield unchecked power to serve himself, Vice President Kamala Harris has only ever had one client: the people,” said Harris-Walz 2024 Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander spokesperson Andrew Peng. “This November, we have the power to protect our freedoms and elect a president who believes in the aspirations of our communities – and will never view us as ‘other.’”   Early voting has hit record levels in battleground Georgia, where elections officials say the vote count has already exceeded more than half of 2020's total turnout. “So over 50% of the turnout for 2020 has already voted in Georgia,” said Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer for the secretary of state's office. ""So for people like Joe Biden & Stacey Abrams, you were wrong saying we had voter suppression here. It’s easy to register & vote in Georgia…and really hard to even try to cheat. Great job by our voters & counties."" More than 2.6 million people in the Peach State have voted early, according to Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's office. The total vote count in the 2020 election was barely under 5 million. former President Trump narrowly lost the state to President Biden by a margin of just 11,779 votes.   Gov. Brian Kemp signed an overhaul of Georgia's election rules into law in 2021, after Trump made unproven claims of widespread voter fraud that purportedly cost him the state's 16 electoral votes in the last presidential election. Republicans said that new restrictions on absentee and mail-in voting, expanded voter ID requirements and prohibitions on non-poll workers from providing food and drink to voters waiting in line at poll centers were necessary to preserve election integrity. Democrats lambasted the changes, accusing GOP lawmakers of failing to back their claims about voter fraud with evidence and using the issue as a cover to suppress votes in minority communities. Earlier this week, Raffensperger told Fox News Digital that early votes could top 4 million by Election Day. Early voting in Georgia runs through Nov. 1.  Podcast host Joe Rogan told former President Trump he has gotten so popular with Americans due to the ""wild s---"" he says. (Screenshots/The Joe Rogan Experience)  Joe Rogan and former President Trump discussed the Republican nominee's growing popularity with young voters, with Rogan noting how America's youth is ""rejecting a lot of this woke bulls--t."" ""Young people are tired of being yelled at and scolded. They're tired of these people that they think are mentally ill telling them what the moral standards of society should be today, and people are upset,"" observed Rogan. ""The rebels are Republicans now,"" he continued. ""Like, you want to be a rebel? You want to be punk rock? You want to, like, buck the system? You're a conservative now. That's how crazy – and then the liberals are now pro-silencing criticism. They're pro-censorship online. They talking about regulating free speech and then regulating the First Amendment. It's bananas to watch."" ""Joe, they come after their political opponents,"" Trump said. ""I've been investigated more than Alfonse Capone."" ""Well, the do,"" agreed Rogan. Trump went on to say that he could have put ""crooked"" Hillary Clinton in jail, but didn't. ""I respected that you didn't,"" said Rogan. ""Because what you said was it would be bad for the country."" ""No, I can't. I couldn't even imagine – You have, first of all, a secretary of state but more importantly, the wife of the president of the United States of America going into jail?"" said Trump.

(Photo by Kyle Mazza/Anadolu via Getty Images)  Vice President Harris told a cheering crowd of 30,000 in Houston that she will fight for ""reproductive freedom"" and accused pro-life Republicans of hypocrisy on the abortion issue. ""These same people who have argued that these Trump abortion bans are investments in women and children, do look at their record. They tend to be in states with the highest rates of maternal mortality in the country,"" Harris said. ""For decades, these extremist leaders, who have neglected prenatal care, maternity care and post-partum care and who now, after continuously failing to support women and children, are claiming to care about women and children – well, I have a question for them. Where have you been?"" Harris claimed Republicans who oppose abortion have also opposed expanding the child tax credit, blocked Democratic proposals that would have lowered child care costs for working parents and advocated for cuts to entitlement programs like WIC and SNAP for poor families. ""The hypocrisy abounds,"" she said.   The number one podcaster in America loves the fact that former President Trump has teamed up with independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. During a three-hour conversation on ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" the titular host asked Trump whether he is ""completely committed"" to having RFK Jr. serve in his administration. ""Oh, I am,"" Trump said. ""But the only thing I want to be a little careful about with him is the environmental. Because, you know, he doesn't like oil. I love oil and gas."" Trump said that Kennedy would be directed to ""focus on health, do whatever you want."" He also revealed that ""big Pharma"" has exerted pressure on him to disassociate from Kennedy. Kennedy is a leading voice in spreading skepticism about vaccines, conflicting with most doctors and scientists who say the benefits of inoculations outweigh rare potential side effects. He has also claimed pharmaceutical companies conspire to prevent health improvements because they profit from selling drugs to people with chronic illness.

The Trump campaign has been targeted by Chinese hackers via phones used by former President Trump and his running mate JD Vance, according to a report. (Ma Yue/VCG via Getty Images)  The U.S. government is investigating unauthorized access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by Chinese hackers, targets of which include the Trump and Harris campaigns. The campaigns have been informed of the potential breach of cellphones used by former President Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, and members of Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing sources familiar with the matter. ""After the FBI identified specific malicious activity targeting the sector, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) immediately notified affected companies, rendered technical assistance, and rapidly shared information to assist other potential victims,"" the FBI and CISA told Fox News Digital in a joint statement. The FBI and CISA said the investigation was ongoing and ""we encourage any organization that believes it might be a victim to engage its local FBI field office or CISA. Agencies across the U.S. Government are collaborating to aggressively mitigate this threat and are coordinating with our industry partners to strengthen cyber defenses across the commercial communications sector."" The hackers are believed to be connected to the Chinese government's intelligence services, The Journal reported. ""We are aware that a highly sophisticated nation-state actor has reportedly targeted several U.S. telecommunications providers to gather intelligence,"" telecommunications company Verizon said in a statement. ""Along with federal law enforcement, industry peers and third-party cyber experts, we are working to confirm, assess and remediate any potential impact. Verizon is committed to assisting law enforcement in this investigation.  Since this is an active investigation, we have no additional comment at this time."" The anonymous officials said that investigators are working to find out if any data was stolen from the campaigns, adding that other people in the U.S. government may have been targeted by the attackers. This is an excerpt from an article by Brie Stimson, David Spunt and Jake Gibson.   Former President Trump accused his opponent Vice President Kamala Harris of ""running a hate campaign"" against him Friday at a rally in Traverse City, Michigan. The Republican nominee took aim at Harris after she and other Democrats have repeatedly called him a ""fascist"" on the campaign trail. ""You know, I think they're calling me a dictator,"" Trump said. ""So they started off where I was a dictator. None of it worked. Then they went to: ‘He’s an evil genius.’ That didn’t work. Then they went: ‘He’s a dumb son of a bitch.’ That didn’t work. That didn’t last too long. Then they went back to the dictator stuff,” Trump said. “Those poor people, those poor lost souls – they're like lost souls. They're radical left lunatics, Democrats. And they all suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome at a level."" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., released a relatively rare joint statement on Friday, demanding Harris cease using ""dangerous rhetoric"" and reminding her of the two recent assassination attempts against Trump. But Harris has so far ignored her GOP critics and continues to warn of ""the danger and the threat that Donald Trump poses to America and the fact that he is unfit to serve"" on the campaign trail. Fox News Digital's Julia Johnson contributed to this update.   The co-founder of Death Row Records, one of the most recognizable and influential record labels in the music industry, spoke to Fox News Digital about why he recently decided to endorse former President Trump over VP Kamala Harris. ""It's about his track record,"" Michael ""Harry-O"" Harris told Fox News Digital about his decision to endorse Trump, who granted Harris clemency from a 33-year prison sentence that had seven years remaining on it as one of his last actions as president. ""The former president, while president, enacted some initiatives that speaks to my community specifically and other people as well."" Harris cited several examples of policies from the first Trump administration that he feels are in line with the goals of his organization, Community First Action, including permanent funding for HBCUs, opportunity zones promoting investment in low income neighborhoods, the First Step Act, and bipartisan legislation combating sickle cell anemia. Polls have increasingly shown that Trump has made significant inroads with the Black community and is expected by many to earn a historically strong share of those votes in November. Harris told Fox News Digital he believes it is due in part to voters trusting that Trump will keep his word, and a lack of movement from the Biden-Harris administration. ""People have more confidence that he will keep his word and I think it's kind of based on some of the same research that we did, that when somebody doesn't campaign on something but actually enacted laws . . . that wants to double down on what he did in the first administration,"" Harris said. ""I haven't heard that from the other side as much. I mean, what I've heard, I believe, frankly, came a little bit too late, too little, too late. And so, when it comes to a balancing act, and you have to make a decision, the critical decision that could affect your life and the life of your family, you have to go based on facts, and the facts are that for the last three and a half years, the previous, the present administration hasn't really focused on our community."" This is an excerpt from an article by Andrew Mark Miller.  CLARKSTON, GEORGIA - OCTOBER 24: Democratic presidential nominee, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, speaks during a campaign rally at the James R Hallford Stadium on October 24, 2024 in Clarkston, Georgia. Harris and Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump, continue campaigning in battleground swing states before the November 5 election. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)  Vice President Kamala Harris is far and away the frontrunner in the battle for campaign cash, an important indicator in presidential politics. According to the latest figures the two major party presidential campaigns filed with the Federal Election Commission, Harris hauled in $97 million during the first half of October. That far outpaced the $16 million former President Trump's campaign said it raised during the first half of this month. Both campaigns use a number of affiliated fundraisings committees to raise money. And when those are included, Trump narrowed the gap, but trailed $176 million to $97 million during the first two weeks of this month. The new filings also spotlight that the Harris campaign continues to vastly outspend the Trump campaign. During the first 16 days of October, the Democratic presidential nominee's campaign outspent Trump $166 million to $99 million, with paid media the top expenditure for both campaigns. However, Harris finished the reporting period with more cash in her coffers. As of Oct. 16, she had $119 million cash on hand, while Trump had $36 million. When joint fundraising committees are also included, Harris holds a $240 million to $168 million cash-on-hand advantage. This is an excerpt from an article by Paul Steinhauser.   Two major national polls
 conducted Sunday through Wednesday and released Friday indicate Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump are in a dead heat. Grabbing headlines first is a New York Times/Siena College survey indicating the Democratic Party and GOP presidential nominees are tied at 48%. That's a switch from a previous poll, earlier this month, when Harris held a slight three-point edge. A CNN survey had the candidates deadlocked at 47% among likely voters nationwide. Its previous poll from late September indicated the vice president had a razor-thin one-point margin. There were warning signs in the two surveys for both candidates, however. Harris lost her favorability advantage over Trump in both polls. After replacing President Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in July, the vice president's favorable ratings soared. But they've steadily eroded over the past month. Another red flag for Harris are polls indicating her support among Black voters is below Biden's levels in the 2020 election. For Trump, his support among White voters is on par with his standing in the 2020 election, when he lost the White House to Biden. And the former president still faces a healthy deficit to the vice president when it comes to being trustworthy and caring about people. While national polls are closely watched, the race for the White House is not based on the national popular vote. It's a battle for the states and their electoral votes. And the latest surveys in the seven crucial battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump and will likely determine whether Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election, are mostly within the margin of error. The latest Fox News national poll indicated Trump had a two-point edge, but Harris had a 6-point advantage among respondents questioned in all seven battleground states. This is an excerpt from an article by Paul Steinhauser.   With 10 days until Election Day, two new major national polls indicate Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump are in a dead heat in the race to succeed President Biden in the White House. With the clock quickly ticking, the two nominees and their running mates are fanning out across the key battleground states this weekend. Trump starts Saturday with a rally in Novi, Michigan, in suburban Detroit. Later in the day, he'll campaign in another of the crucial swing states — Pennsylvania — as he holds a rally in State College, home to Penn State University. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, the Republican vice presidential nominee, starts his day in Atlanta before holding campaign events in Erie and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Top Trump surrogates Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who ended his long-shot White House run and endorsed Trump, and former Democratic presidential candidate and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who days ago switched from an independent to a Republican, will team up for Trump in swing state North Carolina. And Elon Musk, the Tesla and Space X magnate who's the world's richest person, stumps for Trump in Pennsylvania. Harris on Saturday will team up with former first lady Michelle Obama, arguably the most popular Democrat in the country, at a get-out-the-vote rally in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The stop comes two days after the vice president shared the stage in suburban Atlanta with former President Obama. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, makes two stops in battleground Arizona Saturday, first in Window Rock and later in Phoenix. In a sign of just how important a role Pennsylvania is playing with its 19 electoral votes up for grabs, first lady Jill Biden campaigns for Harris in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, while progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a two-time runner-up for the Democratic nomination, stumps for Harris in Erie. This is an excerpt from an article by Paul Steinhauser. Live Coverage begins here"

Philly's firefighters union backs Bob Casey's rival in Senate race,The union representing PA's largest city endorses David McCormick for Senate,Charles Creitz,"October 26, 2024 2:18pm EDT",Elections,"CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten disclosed to viewers Friday that former President Trump could very well win the national popular vote in November, something that hasn’t happened to a Republican presidential candidate in 20 years. The firefighters' union representing Pennsylvania’s largest city endorsed Republican businessman David McCormick in the hotly contested U.S. Senate race Thursday. The president of IAFF Local 22, the union representing more than 4,500 firefighters and first responders in Philadelphia, said this election cycle was the first time they’d met with Sen. Bob Casey, Jr. over his 12 years in office. ""Dave McCormick possesses all the qualities that will catapult us forward,"" union president Mike Bresnan said at a press conference announcing the endorsement. ""We are confident that Dave McCormick will show up when we need him. He is unequivocally the right choice for senator at this pivotal moment in our country’s history."" Dave McCormick, Pennsylvania Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, speaks during Republican presidential nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign rally at Riverfront Sports on Oct. 9, 2024 in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Speaking at the Northern Liberties-based union hall, McCormick said that first responders see first-hand how parts of Philadelphia and the country at-large are struggling and facing the repercussions of lax criminal justice policies. ""We’re here today to talk about exactly why these folks are voting for change, as opposed to the status quo,"" he said. ""We have urban decay, skyrocketing murder rates. They're making sections of this incredible city a terrifying place to raise children,"" he said, as he stood only a mile or so from Kensington, the North Philadelphia neighborhood often dubbed ""America’s largest open-air drug market."" He pointed to ""Soros-funded prosecutors"" in terms of progressive law enforcement policies, naming Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat, as one who has ""undermined the rule of law"" in his work. ""[Casey] has essentially supported policies that have made the jobs of these [firefighters and first responders] a lot tougher. He supports liberal prosecutors like Larry Krasner. He refuses to stand up for a tough order and tough border policies and voted against a total of $800 million in funds for opioid and narcotic detection in the Senate."" McCormick added that Casey also voted against Kate’s Law, a bill that would mandate minimum imprisonment for illegal immigrant felons, after a young woman was murdered by a Mexican national several years ago on a San Francisco pier. The Republican nodded to the fact that the IAFF’s local in Philadelphia endorsed Casey in his re-election bid against former Hazleton mayor and U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., in 2018, appearing to suggest that the nod his way this year was groundbreaking. McCormick concluded by criticizing Casey and others over the closure of the PYREX manufacturing plant in Charleroi, Washington County, Pa., where the company is based. ""He ignored the union workers there for weeks. He only spoke to them after he heard that I was standing with them in solidarity."" Adding to the endorsement, Bresnan said Thursday that McCormick ""is unequivocally the right choice for senator at this pivotal moment in our country’s history."" Philadelphia, both the largest and bluest city in Pennsylvania, has received more attention from statewide Republicans in recent races. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Bob Casey and Dave McCormick are tied in Pennsylvania, according to a new poll. (AP/Reuters) In 2022, Dr. Mehmet Oz visited Kensington to treat the drug addicts in the infamous neighborhood. Former President Donald Trump also stopped just outside the city limits in Trevose recently for his widely-covered ""shift"" at the local McDonald's’ drive-thru. Trump had held an event in Center City earlier in the campaign cycle to celebrate the release of new, branded footwear he was hawking. The former president’s 2016 win was bolstered by votes in Philadelphia’s once-reliably moderate-Republican western and northern suburbs – an area that became disaffected with the right in 2020 in supporting Joe Biden and in 2022 in helping to elect Gov. Josh Shapiro. Fox News Digital reached out to the Casey campaign for comment but did not hear back by press time. Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

American Airlines cracks down against 'gate lice' as airport passengers skip lines amid boarding process,'Gate lice' at airports has American Airlines testing new technology to halt travel phenomenon,Ashley J. DiMella,"October 26, 2024 4:00am EDT",Travel,"A woman who was traveling in Canada captured video of a man pushing his legs into her space on a recent flight. Her TikTok video garnered millions of views and sparked a debate online about travel etiquette. American Airlines is testing new technology to end a process known as ""gate lice,"" which is when passengers cut lines in hopes of boarding a flight early. The system audibly flags when a passenger attempts to board the plane before their designated assignment is called. ""The new technology is designed to ensure customers receive the benefits of priority boarding with ease and helps improve the boarding experience by providing greater visibility into boarding progress for our team,"" an American Airlines spokesperson told Fox News Digital via email. AIRPORT SETS 'MAX' TIME LIMIT ON GOODBYE HUGS FOR TRAVELERS American Airlines is in the early phases of testing the process, piloting the technology at Albuquerque International Sunport, Tucson International Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The slang term ""gate lice"" has gained traction on social media in recent years. Though it's not known who invented the phrase, several travel blogs and Reddit forums discuss ""gate lice"" at length.

A New York Times/Siena College poll has Vice-President Harris polling at the lowest numbers for a Democratic presidential nominee in decades. It comes just hours before former president Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a historic rally at Madison Square Garden, where he is expected to re-iterate that he is making a long-shot play for the state’s 28 electoral college votes. The new poll, released Saturday morning, shows Harris leading Trump by 66% to 27% among registered voters, still a substantial lead but a major decline, judging by President Biden’s 76% to 23% win over Trump in the deep blue city in 2020.

Biden took New York state by 60.87% to Trump’s garnering 37.74%, a 1% gain for the former president, compared to 2016. The Democrats’ struggle for House control in the midterms arguably ran through New York, with the party losing four seats, including several in Democratic-leaning districts.

Michigan shocked the country in 2016 when it backed former President Trump by 0.23 points, or a mere 10,704 votes. Since then, the state has delivered for Democrats, with a nearly three-point win for President Biden, the election and re-election of Gov.

Flipping Kent County, home to Grand Rapids and a representative mix of urban, suburban and rural voters, was also crucial to his victory. Trump will need to take it back for a statewide win in 2024.

Kamala Harris’ billionaire friend Laurene Powell Jobs owns liberal mag behind ‘widely disputed’ Trump report,Widow of Apple visionary Steve Jobs purchased a majority of The Atlantic in 2017,Brian Flood,"October 26, 2024 7:00am EDT",Media,"Fox & Friends weigh in after Mayra Guillen called out The Atlantic for exploiting the death of her sister, Vanessa. The Atlantic has faced intense scrutiny in recent days for an unflattering report about former President Trump that has been declared everything from ""false"" to a ""hit piece"" by critics and even those involved with the story, and a look at the high-powered owner of the liberal publication reveals a ""genuine friendship"" with Vice President Kamala Harris. Billionaire philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple visionary Steve Jobs and one of the wealthiest people on earth, owns the Emerson Collective, which purchased a majority of The Atlantic in 2017. Powell Jobs and Harris are both 60-year-old women who rose to prominence in liberal Northern California, but they have much more in common. The New York Times reported last month that Powell Jobs, who is reportedly worth north of $11 billion, is one of Harris’ ""most essential confidantes"" who has shelled out cash and provided counsel in order to help expand the vice president’s public profile. ""Now, in this year’s presidential race, the wealthiest woman in Silicon Valley has emerged as a powerful player behind the scenes. She has quietly contributed millions of dollars to an organization backing Ms. Harris, according to three people briefed on the gifts,"" the Times reported. THE ATLANTIC REPORT ALLEGING TRUMP DISPARAGED SLAIN ARMY PRIVATE BLASTED BY FAMILY, OTHERS: 'ABSOLUTELY FALSE' Vice President Kamala Harris is extremely close with billionaire Laurene Powell Jobs, who controls The Atlantic.  (Photographer: David Swanson/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""She played a hidden but key role in helping usher Mr. Biden out of the race, which cleared the way for a Harris run,"" the Times continued. ""Powell Jobs, who is so close to the vice president that her staff refers to her simply as ‘L.P.J.,’ is positioned to have extraordinary influence, or at least access, in a potential Harris administration."" The Times noted that three dozen sources with ""insight into their bond"" believe Harris and Powell Jobs have a ""genuine friendship built on a shared political philosophy, an interest in art and culture and their mutual trials as women in the public spotlight."" When Harris was sworn into office as a United States Senator in 2017, she summoned Powell Jobs to hop into a photo alongside her family. ""My extended family is here,"" Harris said as she waved in Powell Jobs and other close friends, the Times reported. Harris and Powell Jobs have gone on personal trips together, sometimes on the philanthropist’s private plane, according to the Times. Powell Jobs attended Harris’ 2014 wedding to Doug Emhoff, and Emhoff attended the wedding of Powell Jobs’ son in Hawaii earlier this year. Powell Jobs has also visited the Biden-Harris White House at least nine times, according to the Times.

Powell Jobs, who was married to Steve Jobs from 1991 until his death in 2011 and paid roughly $70 million for the most expensive home in San Francisco earlier this year, has also opened her wallet to help elect Harris while urging others to do the same. Powell Jobs has reportedly been urging other influential women and megadonors to support Harris, although the Times noted she likes to make ""undisclosed contributions"" and she has ""donated millions to Future Forward’s dark-money vehicle"" as friends have pondered whether she would seek a formal role in the administration if her friend prevails. Many of her donations are undisclosed, but Powell Jobs has openly donated to a plethora of high-profile Democrats over the years, including Chuck Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Barbara Boxer, Andrew Cuomo, Gavin Newsom, Beto O’Rourke, Kirsten Gillibrand, Tammy Duckworth, Dianne Feinstein, Elizabeth Warren, Kathleen Hochul, Cory Booker, Andrew Gillum, Adam Schiff, and Nancy Pelosi, in addition to Harris and groups such as Planned Parenthood, according to Open Secrets.

Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, inherited her husband’s multibillion-dollar fortune after the visionary’s death in 2011. (John Nacion / Contributor) Fortune also put a recent spotlight on the close friendship between Powell Jobs and Harris last month with a piece that called the Atlantic honcho one of the vice president’s ""biggest bankrollers."" ""Not only has Powell Jobs consistently donated to Democrats, but she’s also taken a special interest in her friend Harris. In 2023, Powell Jobs made three donations to the Biden and Harris reelection campaigns, amounting to nearly $1 million,"" Fortune reported. Powell Jobs has posted on X in support of liberal causes such as a pathway to citizenship for immigrants, various climate change initiatives and LGBTQ+ Pride, although she has been silent on the platform since it was purchased by fellow billionaire Elon Musk. In 2017, Powell Jobs brought then-Senator Harris along for an on-stage interview with journalist Kara Swisher at the Code Conference. Swisher asked the friends if one of them would run for president in 2020, Powell Jobs said, ""One of us should… I vote for her,"" while pointing to Harris. STEVE JOBS' WIDOW GRABS $94 MILLION CALIFORNIA LOT Laurene Powell Jobs ""is positioned to have extraordinary influence, or at least access, in a potential Harris administration,"" according to The New York Times.  (Jemal Countess / Stringer) Seven years later, as speculation builds that Powell Jobs could be either directly involved or at least extremely influential behind-the-scenes in a potential Harris White House, her liberal news organization has found itself the center of attention with a brutal story about Trump that's been both widely disseminated and scrutinized. The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg penned a lengthy report published Tuesday about Trump's interaction with the family of 20-year-old Vanessa Guillén, the daughter of Mexican immigrants who was murdered in April 2020 by a fellow soldier at Fort Hood. After her remains were discovered two months later, Trump consoled Guillén's family at the White House and offered to provide financial assistance to cover the funeral costs. But Goldberg reported Trump became enraged when he got the bill, refusing to pay it, saying, ""It doesn’t cost 60,000 bucks to bury a f---ing Mexican!"" According to the report, Natalie Khawam, Guillén's family attorney, told Goldberg the family did not receive money from Trump and that the costs were ultimately covered in part by the Army and donations. Khawam has since accused The Atlantic’s Goldberg of lying. Guillén's sister, Mayra Guillén, also blasted The Atlantic report and voiced her support for Trump.

( Jemal Countess/Getty Images for The Atlantic) NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck, a conservative media watchdog, criticized The Atlantic as a ""political laundering operation for Laurene Powell Jobs and her fellow liberal elites"" to push their talking points. ""She has a vapid editor-in-chief in Jeffrey Goldberg who not only shares her worldview, but has shown himself to be the ultimate pinprick showing a ruthless arrogance,"" Houck told Fox News Digital. ""If Laurene Powell Jobs told him to write a story about how Trump is good, he’d comply because that’s his role in the world,"" Houck added. ""The Atlantic is where White liberals go to feel like they’re still in charge and can claim they think more deeply and care more than the rubes out in real America."" Goldberg’s Atlantic piece laid out another explosive claim in the piece that Trump had once said, ""I need the kind of generals that Hitler had. People who were totally loyal to him, that follow orders,"" citing two unnamed sources who allegedly heard him say it in the White House. A spokesman for Trump called the claim ""absolutely false,"" telling The Atlantic, ""President Trump never said this."" The Atlantic firmly pushed back on the notion that Powell Jobs was involved in the Goldberg piece, or any editorial decisions. ""There is a strict firewall between The Atlantic's newsroom and our business side and ownership. The editorial team operates with complete independence. Our ownership does not and has never influenced what we report or publish,"" The Atlantic senior vice president of communications Anna Bross told Fox News Digital. CNN DATA GURU SAYS THERE IS A 60% CHANCE THE ELECTION ENDS WITH AN 'ELECTORAL COLLEGE BLOWOUT' Fox News contributor Joe Concha said The Atlantic’s attempt to harm Trump days before the election ""has no legs."" ""It was widely disputed, including by the family involved, and this reporter has a history of engaging in Democratic activism. Remember, remember, Jeffrey Goldberg is the same so-called journalist who pushed the ‘suckers and losers’ hoax. That was in 2020, and at the time he promised more corroboration of this alleged comment by Trump would be brought forth… we’re still waiting,"" Concha told Fox News Digital. ""Voters have been hearing for nine years that Trump is Hitler,"" Concha added. ""And, therefore, these stories don’t move the needle one bit."" But despite the denials and harsh rebuttals, The Atlantic’s attempted takedown of Trump provided CNN and MSNBC with talking points for much of the week. The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Emerson Collective did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Young voter turned off by Harris' 'pandering': Seems like abortion is 'only thing I'm allowed to care about',Conservative influencer Isabel Brown says there's 'clear disconnect' between Harris' platform and voters,Madeline Coggins,"October 26, 2024 7:00am EDT",Media,"Young voter panelists CJ Pearson, Isabel Brown, Link Lauren and Reed Cleland weigh in on top issues for voters under 30 on ‘The Faulkner Focus.’ With less than two weeks until Election Day, Vice President Harris and former President Trump are working to score points with a critical voting bloc - young Americans. While Trump has made strides with the voting group, Kamala Harris was called out by a Gen Z conservative influencer, who claims young women are tired of being ""pandered"" to by the campaign. ""I'm a young woman, and I'm being constantly pandered to on the campaign trail. About the only thing I'm allowed to care about, according to Kamala Harris, is a woman's supposed constitutional right to an abortion,"" influencer Isabel Brown said on ""The Faulkner Focus."" HARRIS CAMPAIGN FACES WARNING SIGNS WITH YOUNG VOTERS IN ARIZONA: REPORT Brown added there is a ""clear disconnect with where the culture of America is today, not just economic issues, but I think we're looking for someone who can truly bring a new generation of leadership to Washington, new ideas, a fresh perspective. And that's not happening with the Kamala Harris regime."" The sitting vice president has benefited from major celebrity endorsements and rode post-Democratic National Convention hype through the past weeks of campaigning. In the final stages of the 2024 race, she has shifted her strategy to focus on a media blitz while still struggling to address tough questions on her tenure in office and policy plans. ""I think Kamala Harris is still coasting on vibes and coconut memes when all we want to hear is how is she going to make life more affordable for everyday Americans. The forgotten men and women in this country who feel left behind by the political elites,"" content creator Link Lauren told host Harris Faulkner.

""I'm reminded of why I should vote for President Trump every single time I go to a grocery store. Every time I fill up a gas tank, I think this is something that is on the minds of every single voter, every single time they swipe their credit card under this administration,"" RNC youth advisory council co-chair CJ Pearson said. ""We need young people to vote because it's our future on the ballot. If we don't make our voices heard, who will speak for us?"" - CJ Pearson ""I've got a lot to complain about these days. Whether it's runaway inflation, record high gas prices, or an economy where Americans can't even focus on how they can thrive because they're too busy focusing on how they can survive under the Kamala Harris, Joe Biden administration,"" he continued. Cortland County, N.Y. legislator Reed Cleland pushed back during the panel, arguing the country ""can't afford"" another Trump presidency. He pointed to the former president's tax cuts and foreign policy decisions, claiming Harris has ""laid out an agenda for working people."" ""Presidential elections matter. State elections matter. Local elections matter. Local officials make decisions on a day-to-day basis that affect people's lives every single day. There are races up and down the ballot,"" Cleland concluded. According to a recent NYT/Siena poll, 25% of young voters say the economy is the top issue facing the country. The second-biggest issue among the voting bloc is abortion at 19%. Other issues include inflation and the cost of living, immigration and the character and competence of the candidates.

""They feel like these adults we elected to lead by example, they're the ones who racked up $35 trillion of debt. They're the reason we have an immigration crisis, wars around the world, housing crisis, chronic disease crisis. But they're also millions of young people who I think are looking at Donald Trump for the first time and saying he looks like the change agent in this election. Kamala Harris very much looks like politics as usual."" Madeline Coggins is a Digital Production Assistant on the Fox News flash team with Fox News Digital."

Former Republican New Jersey Gov.

There are just 11 days until Election Day. Christie suggested that undecided voters still didn't ""know"" Harris and that she had failed to distinguish herself from President Biden and his policies. ""Ten days ago I would've told you that she's going to win. And I think she's had a bad ten days,"" he began. ""There’s advantages and disadvantages to coming into the race this late.

"Dementia risk could be higher for older adults who experience this type of injury, study finds",Researchers reveal a ‘diagnostic pattern’ that tends to come before a dementia diagnosis,Shiv Sudhakar,"October 26, 2024 4:30am EDT",Health,"As more doctors and nurses leave the profession, providers are turning to AI technology to help bridge the coverage gap, especially among older Americans. Getting injured after a fall may be an early warning sign of dementia in older adults. That’s according to a new study published in JAMA Network Open last month. ""This study quantifies a diagnostic pattern that geriatricians and primary care providers have recognized for quite some time – falls often precede a dementia diagnosis and older adults who experience a fall should undergo cognitive screening,"" co-author Molly P. Jarman, PhD., deputy director of the Center for Surgery and Public Health at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and assistant professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School, told Fox News Digital. PREVENT DANGEROUS FALLS AMONG OLDER ADULTS BY TAKING KEY STEPS The Boston researchers analyzed U.S. Medicare claims data for more than two million adults age 66 and older who were diagnosed with a traumatic injury that resulted in an emergency department visit or hospital admission from 2014 to 2015. Half of the injuries were the result of falls. Getting injured after a fall may be an early warning sign of dementia in older adults, according to a new study. (iStock) The researchers also reviewed follow-up data for at least one year after the injury, tracking how often the participants were diagnosed with dementia. Falls are the leading cause of injury for adults 65 years and older. Among the patients who experienced a fall, 10.6% were diagnosed with some type of dementia within a year. The study also analyzed data from older adults who experienced an injury from an event other than falling, such as a motor vehicle collision. ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE: EARLY SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS YOU MAY SPOT IN YOURSELF OR A LOVED ONE ""Among the older adults with other types of injury, only 6.1% were subsequently diagnosed with dementia,"" Jarman noted. After accounting for variables that could potentially influence the results — such as demographics, the severity of injury and underlying medical issues — the patients with fall-related injuries were 20% more likely to be diagnosed with dementia compared to those with other types of injury. Approximately one in 10 U.S. adults over the age of 65 has dementia, past research shows. One of the main limitations of the research is that it only looked at records back in time – so it’s unclear whether falls are causing dementia or if older adults who are at risk for dementia are more likely to experience a fall, according to the researchers. Approximately one in 10 U.S. adults over the age of 65 has dementia, past research shows. (iStock) ""We believe the latter is most likely – older adults with mild cognitive impairment or undiagnosed dementia may be more likely to experience a fall due to changes in their gait and balance,"" Jarman told Fox News Digital. ""The fall then leads them to have more interaction with the health care system, which results in their dementia diagnosis."" ""When we hear chest pain, we think heart attack — and when we hear falling, we should be thinking dementia risk."" Michael S. Okun, M.D., medical advisor to the Parkinson’s Foundation and director of the Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases at the University of Florida Health, confirmed that when older adults start falling, this could be a potential warning symptom. He was not part of the study. AGING MAY SPEED UP AFTER DEATH OF A LOVED ONE, STUDY FINDS: 'MAJOR LIFE STRESSOR' ""When, for example, we hear chest pain, we think heart attack — and similarly, when we hear falling, we should be thinking about dementia risk,"" Okun told Fox News Digital. ""A good rule of thumb would be to initiate an examination of thinking ability as soon as possible for new onset falling."" It is not routine practice to perform cognitive screening for older adults who experience a fall, according to Jarman. ""We hope that the results of our study will encourage clinicians to monitor the cognitive health of older adults who fall,"" she said. Patients with fall-related injuries were 20% more likely to be diagnosed with dementia compared to those with other types of injury. (iStock) Clinicians could start screening during the initial hospitalization after a fall, Jarman suggested, and the patient’s primary care physician or a geriatrician could then perform a follow-up screening. ""The notion that an elderly person needs only physical therapy after a fall is wrong,"" Okun added. ""We should be teaching folks the value of examining brain function in fallers."" Falls are the leading cause of injury for adults 65 years and older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). An older adult falls about every second of every day, with one in four reporting falling each year, the same source states. AGING SLOWDOWN COULD BE SURPRISE BENEFIT OF EXISTING MEDICATION, RESEARCH SHOWS ""Falls can lead to serious, even life-threatening, injuries in older adults,"" Jarman cautioned. To prevent falls, the CDC recommends completing an inspection to make sure your home is safe.  (iStock) ""Patients who fall are at a high risk of losing independence."" Most falls occur because of a combination of risk factors — and the more risk factors someone has, the greater the likelihood of a fall, the CDC warns. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The agency recommends four practices to prevent falls. First, have an honest discussion with your health care provider about your personal risk of falls, the CDC recommends. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER That also includes reviewing all medications if there is any chance they could make you feel sleepy or dizzy. Regular exercise, such as Tai Chi, helps to improve balance and make your legs stronger to reduce your chances of falling. Experts recommend asking your doctor which regimen is best for you. The CDC recommends getting your eyes and feet checked every year and talking to your health provider about proper footwear. Regular exercise helps to improve balance and make your legs stronger to reduce your chances of falling.  (iStock) Some people may have undiagnosed vision problems, like glaucoma or cataracts, which can increase the risk of falling, the same source noted. Lastly, the agency recommends completing an inspection to make sure your home is safe. This includes removing clutter, using double-sided tape to keep rugs from slipping, placing items in cabinets that can be easily reached without a step stool, installing grab bars next to and inside tubs, and placing non-slip mats on shower floors.

Trump isn’t the first president menaced by Derangement Syndrome,"Democrats used every means at their disposal to hobble, hinder and delegitimize the Trump first term",James Robbins,"October 26, 2024 10:00am EDT",Opinion,"Dr. Jordan Peterson attempts to get to the bottom of why some people seem to have 'Trump Derangement Syndrome.' A Republican presidential candidate endangering democracy, threatening the Constitution and such a menace to America he could foment a civil war? Yes, this is what Fire-Eater Southern Democrats said about former Congressman Abraham Lincoln during the 1860 presidential campaign. And their irrational fear of him winning the White House made all their dire predictions come true. Lincoln, the so-called abolitionist ""Black Republican,"" endured nonstop personal attacks. The Charleston, South Carolina, Mercury wrote, ""a horrid looking wretch he is – sooty and scoundrelly in aspect – a cross between the nutmeg dealer, the horse-swapper, and the nightman [who empties the privies]."" He was ""a creature, fit evidently, for petty treason, small stratagems, and all sorts of spoils."" Former President Trump is seen with blood on his face as Secret Service agents hustle him off stage after he was shot in Butler, Pennsylvania, July 13, 2024. (Rebecca Droke/AFP via Getty Images) The Southerners were also terrified by the 1860 Republican Party platform, which they denounced in frenzied language similar to contemporary progressive critics of Project 2025. DEMOCRATS AND THE MEDIA BROUGHT TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME TO A FEVER PITCH. NOW IT'S DRAWN BLOOD The Tarboro, North Carolina, Southerner declared that ""the Platform on which Abraham Lincoln was nominated… is tantamount to a declaration of War against Southern rights and institutions."" If Lincoln took office the ""Constitution would be a dead letter"" and attempts to resist would be a ""signal for revolution."" Democrats kept Lincoln off the ballots in the South, just as they’d later endeavor to deny former President Trump access earlier this year. But Lincoln won the four-way race regardless, and Republicans gained a majority in Congress. The worst fears of the Fire-Eaters were realized. This in itself did not signal the apocalypse for the pro-slavery South. A president, even an abolitionist, could not end the grim institution of slavery with the stroke of a pen. Nor could Congress, even with a Republican majority, bring about slavery’s demise through normal legislation. The pro-slavery Taney Supreme Court had seen to that in the Dred Scott case. Had the Southern Democrats been less obsessed with Lincoln they could have simply bided their time and let the politics play out. The moderate Richmond, Virginia, Whig argued that Lincoln’s victory was not an existential threat because the United States was still a nation of laws. SEAN HANNITY: TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME IS VERY REAL ""Lincoln, within the Constitution and the laws, will and must be sustained,"" the editors wrote. ""Lincoln, transgressing the laws or abusing the Constitution, will be rebuked, checked or punished."" The same day Abraham Lincoln delivered his plea for unity, the Confederates raised their first national flag over their then-capital in Montgomery, Alabama. (Photo by © CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images) But the Fire-Eaters were so apoplectic at Lincoln’s victory that they drove seven Southern states to secede from the Union even before the new president took office. Their blind fear of the new order overwhelmed any rational reaction. Some even imagined a preemptive insurrection, and Lincoln had to be smuggled into the capital for his inauguration. The Fayetteville, Tennessee, Observer stated flatly, ""the South will never permit Abraham Lincoln to be inaugurated President of the United States… whether the Potomac is crimsoned human gore, and Pennsylvania Avenue is paved ten fathoms in depth with mangled bodies."" Southerners would never consent to the ""humiliation and degradation"" of Lincoln’s ascent. GREG GUTFELD: TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME EVOLVED INTO A DISEASE Drawing of Abraham Lincoln's first presidential inauguration, Mar. 4, 1861. Lincoln waves to an audience of men wearing top hats. (Undated illustration.) This is the context to Lincoln’s first inaugural address on March 4, 1861, in which he pleaded with the rebel states that there was no cause for apprehension and that he did not threaten even the institution of slavery they were intent on preserving. All would be forgiven if only they would return. ""We are not enemies, but friends,"" Lincoln said, invoking ""the mystic chords of memory"" to ""swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."" But the better angels were outgunned by the lesser demons. The same day Lincoln delivered his plea for unity, the Confederates raised their first national flag over their then-capital in Montgomery, Alabama. Congressional attempts at cooperation and reconciliation, such as the famous Crittenden Compromise, failed. The bombardment of Fort Sumter, in Charleston, South Carolina, in April 1861. (Engraving by Perine/Photo by Charles Phelps Cushing/ClassicStock/Getty Images) Ultimately, the Fire-Eaters forced the issue by attacking Fort Sumter, Lincoln mobilized troops, the upper South joined the rebellion, and the Civil War was on. ADRIANA COHEN: TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME IS BEST TREATED WITH THIS When reviewing the four-month period from the 1860 election to Lincoln’s inauguration, one can’t help but conclude that the Civil War was completely avoidable. There was no sound cause for secession. There was no reason for outrage. Lincoln was not a dictator, nor could he be. But the country was driven into the abyss by a small group of radical Democrats who stubbornly refused to accept Lincoln as a legitimately elected president. Likewise, today, reporters hound Trump for not pledging to back the outcome of the election but can’t be bothered to ask Democrats if they would do the same should Trump emerge the victor. We saw after 2016 that the answer to this question is no. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In the years that followed, Democrats used every means at their disposal to hobble, hinder and delegitimize the Trump first term. The current never-Trumpers are motivated by the same irrational, blind hatred that animated the anti-Lincoln Fire-Eaters who would rather drive the country into violent civil conflict than see the object of their disgust as president. But as Lincoln said, truth and justice ""will surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal of the American people."" And if President Trump wins, the better angels will have to work overtime to keep the peace. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Dr. James S.

"Meet the American who invented the hard hat, a proud symbol of our nation's working class","Army veteran Edward W. Bullard patented the first construction hard hat, inspired by helmets worn in WWI trenches",Kerry J. Byrne,"October 18, 2024 3:30am EDT",LIFESTYLEDeals,"Edward W. Bullard created a key invention that changed America forever. Hard hats are the team headgear of working-class America — the people who built the United States with their bare hands. The people who still build the USA today. Tip your safety cap to Edward W. Bullard (1893-1963), a U.S. Army veteran who crafted the world's most important piece of industrial protective equipment after returning from the carnage of World War I. ""Hard-hat workers are brave people doing important work,"" said Wells Bullard, CEO of E.D. Bullard Co. in Kentucky, a manufacturer of personal safety equipment. She's also a great-granddaughter of the hard-hat inventor. MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INVENTED THE ELECTRIC GUITAR AND INSPIRED ROCK ‘N’ ROLL ""They are the people building our roads, bridges and infrastructure, moving our economy forward,"" she added. The effort requires a lot of Bullard's hard hats. Edward W. Bullard, a veteran of World War I, invented the hard hat in 1919. It was inspired by the helmets worn by American doughboys.  (Bullard) Some 33 million Americans, about 10 percent of the national population, work hard-hat jobs today, according to Cam Mackey, president and CEO of the International Safety Equipment Association. Edward Bullard helped found the nonprofit trade association in 1933. The hard hat today is more than just an important piece of personal safety equipment. It came to symbolize the growing schism between working-class Americans and leftist elitists during the Vietnam War, most notably during the New York City Hard Hat Riot of 1970. Construction workers, incensed by images of people burning American flags, walked off their job sites en masse and clashed with largely college-educated, white-collar anti-American protesters in Lower Manhattan. Some 33 million Americans, about 10 percent of the national population, work hard-hat jobs today. About 150 people were battered and bloodied on the streets, 40 of them suffered head wounds, six men were beaten unconscious, David Paul Kuhn, author of ""The Hardhat Riot: Nixon, New York City, and the Dawn of the White Working-Class Revolution,"" told Fox News Digital. ""After that day, the hard hat became a political symbol,"" he said. Demonstrators marched with American flags during the Hard Hat Riot in New York City in May 1970. Working-class, pro-American demonstrators clashed with anti-Vietnam War protesters. More than 100 people were injured.  (Stuart Lutz/Gado/Getty Images) The nation is still dealing with the fallout today. The hard hat carries symbolism far from the job site. Edward R. Bullard was born in Liberty, N.M., on Dec. 1, 1893 before moving as a young boy with his family to California. His father, Edward D. Bullard, founded the E.D. Bullard Co. in San Francisco in 1898, providing lamps and other gear to miners who flooded the region during the Gold Rush. The company in recent decades moved its operations to Kentucky. The younger Bullard graduated from the University of California at Berkeley before shipping off to France in World War I.

(The Print Collector/Print Collector/Getty Images) ""He was in the trenches in Europe,"" Wells Bullard said, then returned from war to work at the family business. AMERICAN SOLDIERS KILLED IN WWI REMEMBERED FOREVER IN NYC ALE HOUSE ""Realizing the need for greater safety within the mines, Bullard designed a hard hat for miners inspired by the steel doughboy helmet he wore as a soldier,"" states a Bullard company biography. ""The helmet was made of canvas, glue and black paint, and given the trademarked name ‘Hard Boiled’ because of the steam used in the manufacturing process,"" the National Museum of American History reports. Edward W. Bullard invented the hard hat in 1919. Early models were called Hard Boiled Hats, as steam was used to bind together the various layers of protection. (Smithsonian/National Museum of American History) The Hard Boiled Hat, first developed in 1919, quickly evolved with better designs and safety measures, including webbing to provide a cushion of space between the helmet shell and a worker's head.

His hard hat soon played a crucial role in some of the nation’s most ambitious — and most dangerous — construction projects. Edward Bullard invented his original ""hard boiled"" construction hat in 1919, and filed a patent for an improved hard hat in 1927.  (Public domain) The Golden Gate Bridge, built between 1933 and 1937, was the first major construction project to require hard hats on the job — Bullard's hard hats. He was inspired to help with the project after realizing the deadly danger posed by falling rivets. More than 1.2 million rivets hold together the majestic bridge. Eleven men died on the project, a horrific figure by today's standards — but the death total was far better than the standards of the day. Any one of them could prove deadly.

Hard hats became mandatory on most job sites with the passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in December 1970. The year proved critical in the history of the hard hat. Hard hats were at the center of America’s culture war in 1970, when blood spilled on the streets of Manhattan. Anti-American protests erupted around the nation in the wake of the killing of four Kent State University students on May 4 that year.

""By an accident of history, these protests took place right below one of the greatest concentrations of blue-collar workers in American history,"" said author Kuhn. That would be the World Trade Center. Some 5,000 hard-hat workers toiled every day in 1970 on the colossal construction project, including its iconic Twin Towers, just blocks from the protests.

""The Hard Hat Riot was the prelude to the divide we now live with in America."" — David Paul Kuhn New York City's hard-hat workers had enough. They left the World Trade Center, and other job sites around the city, and descended on downtown Manhattan to take back their country — hard hats resting proudly on their heads. ""The construction workers marched on through the narrow streets of the Financial District toward City Hall, where they sang ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ and demanded that Mayor Lindsay raise the flags to full-mast,"" reports Smithsonian Magazine. ""They eventually got their way."" Working-class American rallied around President Nixon during the 1972 campaign, as demonstrated by this Nixon hard hat bumper sticker.  (David Paul Kuhn) The media quickly dubbed it the Hard Hat Riot. The violent scuffle ""was the prelude to the divide we now live with in America between the white working class and the highly educated elite,"" said Kuhn. Working-class America rallied for President Richard Nixon during his 1972 re-election bid, helping him win 49 of 50 states and 61% of the popular vote over Democrat George McGovern.

In the trend dubbed ""sleep divorce,"" traveling couples are reportedly searching for ways to get more shut-eye during vacation, according to Hilton’s 2025 Trends report. The Virginia-based hospitality company said nearly two-thirds of travelers, or 63%, admit that they sleep better when they’re alone. AIRPORT SETS 'MAX' TIME LIMIT ON GOODBYE HUGS FOR TRAVELERS ""In fact, 37% of travelers prefer to sleep in a separate bed from their partner when traveling, and most of those traveling with children (3 in 4) think it’s best to sleep apart from their kids while traveling,"" Hilton's travel report said.

Researchers investigated a new approach to treating the disease in a study funded by Cancer Research UK. In a phase 3 trial, patients went through a short, six-week course of chemotherapy before starting standard chemoradiation (CRT) treatment. CERVICAL CANCER DEATHS COULD BE REDUCED WITH HOME HPV TESTING, STUDY FINDS This approach was found to slash death risk by 40%, and it also reduced the likelihood of the disease returning or relapsing by 35%. There are about 11,500 new cervical cancer diagnoses in the U.S. each year and about 4,000 women die from the disease, according to the CDC. (iStock) After five years, 80% of trial participants who received the induction chemo session followed by CRT survived, and 73% reported that their cancer had not returned or spread. Dr. Mary McCormack, PhD, one of the trial researchers, shared with Fox News Digital that this method led to an 8% absolute improvement in survival rates at five years. CERVICAL CANCER DRUG RAISES SURVIVAL RATE BY 30% COMPARED TO CHEMOTHERAPY: ‘GAME-CHANGER’ Over the team's decade-long research, McCormack noted that there have been some changes in standard radiation delivery. ""As this was a randomized trial, these changes, which were incorporated into the study, were taken into account and affected both arms of the trial equally,"" she said. After five years, 80% of trial participants who received the induction chemo followed by CRT survived by the five-year mark.

James Franco is 'grateful' for being canceled after sexual misconduct allegations,The 46-year-old actor was first accused of sexual misconduct in 2018,Christina Dugan Ramirez,"October 25, 2024 4:50pm EDT",EntertainmentVIDEOVIDEOVIDEOEntertainmentCrimeEntertainment Newsletter,"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here. It's been years since James Franco's career took a drastic turn due to the sexual misconduct allegations made against him in 2018. But, now, the 46-year-old actor is looking back at the trials and tribulations with gratitude and a whole new perspective on life. In a new interview with Variety, Franco — who stars in the upcoming Italian film ""Hey Joe"" — opened up about the self-work he's done since he was accused of coercing his film students into performing explicit sex scenes on camera and explained why his outlook on work, life and everything in between has shifted for the better. ""I’m so grateful to be working,"" said Franco, who portrays an alcoholic American WWII veteran in the new movie. ""I did go through a lawsuit, and during that lawsuit I wasn’t working. But then COVID hit, so everybody wasn’t working. So, I don’t know, it was all… I mean, we were all kind of in it.

""And even when there were good moments — like a movie that people liked or, I don’t know, [being] nominated for an award or whatever it might be, whatever good moments along the way that I wish I could have appreciated — I just didn’t because I had this weird thing where it was just like, I always need more.""

They argued they were victims of fraud, paying $300 a month for an acting school opened by Franco and his business partner Vince Jolivette in 2014 at which they claimed they were intimidated and sexually objectified. In June 2021, Franco settled the lawsuit and signed off on paying $2,235,000. Since then, the actor said he's dedicated his time and energy to moving forward and becoming the best version of himself.

And so, as painful as it was — yes, of course rejection is painful, being told you’re bad is painful. But ultimately that’s kind of what I needed to just stop going the way I was going.""

Braun advised travelers not to bring an assumed infested suitcase into a living space, but rather keep it outside the home before placing the clothes in a trash bag and immediately into a laundry room.

Singer Beyoncé is expected to join Vice President Kamala Harris during a rally in Houston on Friday, the Associated Press reported Thursday. Harris will head to the Republican state of Texas on Friday, when she will hold a rally spotlighting the state's abortion laws following the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Associated Press reported Thursday morning that Harris will be joined by Beyoncé, citing three people familiar with the event. Beyoncé, who is from Houston, has not yet endorsed Harris for president, but her song ""Freedom"" has become a hallmark of Harris' rallies, including using it as Harris' walk-up song before she addresses supporters.

What is landlord insurance? How coverage could play into a squatter situation,"Insurance typically doesn't cover the costs endured by a landlord from a squatter, but one company has set out to change that",Ashlyn Messier,"October 26, 2024 11:43am EDT",US,"Attorney Kevin Hughes speaks on the plight of William and Arlene Towns, whose Colorado home was reportedly taken over by a homeless family who took advantage of their kindness and refused to leave. Landlord insurance typically doesn't cover costs accrued in a squatter situation. Proper Insurance, which offers short-term rental insurance, created a unique type of coverage coming out of the COVID pandemic, that is specifically designated to protect property owners in a situation where a renter refuses to leave the property once their lease has ended. When an individual decides to turn one of their properties into a rental, they need insurance apart from homeowners insurance. Landlord insurance traditionally covers things like property damage, lost rental income if something is to happen to the property that makes it uninhabitable and liability protection, according to Investopedia. Proper Insurance, which offers short-term rental coverage for property owners, created a way for individuals to be financially protected from squatter situations.  (iStock) SECURITY MEASURES, TECHNOLOGY, OTHER DEVICES YOU CAN USE TO DEFEND YOUR HOME FROM SQUATTERS Additional typical coverage options include flood insurance, emergency coverage, guaranteed income insurance and additional construction expenses. One type of coverage that does not often fall under the landlord insurance umbrella is squatter coverage. Squatter situations can cause huge expenses to fall on the shoulders of property owners. ""One issue with squatting, particularly, is that squatters come with property damage,"" Nick Massey, director of sales, Proper Insurance told Fox News Digital in a phone call. Proper Insurance's squatter coverage covers legal expenses and loss of revenue that could come from a squatter, and also property damage that is caused, according to Massey. The squatter protection coverage offered through Proper Insurance is used in cases where an individual signs a lease and then refuses to leave once the lease comes to an end.  (iStock) HIRE THIS TYPE OF LAWYER, AND REMOVE SQUATTERS FROM YOUR PROPERTY MORE EFFECTIVELY This type of coverage is not widely available, with a good number of insurance policies coming with ""an exclusion around property entrustment,"" Massey said, which means that when someone is let into a home, and then vandalizes that property, the insurance company is not going to cover those costs, he explained. Proper Insurance's coverage is unique to those renting out on a short- and mid-term basis. ""A little over 10 years ago, our ownership team set out to create an insurance policy designed for the modern property investor,"" Massey told Fox News Digital. The squatter coverage came into play during the COVID pandemic, when vacations were widely halted, and homeowners allowed longer stays in their rental units. SELF-HELP EVICTION METHODS TO REMOVE SQUATTERS COULD LEAD TO LEGAL TROUBLE FOR HOMEOWNERS ""Fast forward into the COVID pandemic, short-term rentals are more or less shut down across the country,"" Massey said. ""Nobody's really traveling, but we start to see the movement of intrastate travel from people out of the metros into short-term rental homes, kind of more remote for these longer term stays, and these stays being 30-, 45-, 60-, sometimes 90-day terms that these folks are staying at these properties."" Those homeowners who went from short-term rentals to longer-term arrangements echoed similar concerns, Massey said. ""What if they don’t leave?"" ""We immediately responded to that question by creating a new coverage that has never been done before, ever, anywhere, with our squatter protection,"" Massey said. Proper Insurance's coverage is geared towards those renting out properties on a short- and mid-term basis.  (iStock) Squatter protection, which comes at an additional premium, can be used in those situations where a renter signs a lease, the lease comes to a close, and then the person refuses to leave the property. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""[It was created] to allow some more flexibility and peace of mind for these folks who are going to take longer-term stays,"" Massey explained. Out of the COVID pandemic also came ""a new industry called mid-term rentals,"" Massey told Fox News Digital. ""So we have short-term, long-term, and now we have mid-term rentals, which primarily curates to traveling nurses . . . mostly the medical professional field, but these homeowners are taking that as an opportunity to house these folks in their property, but they stay longer term. In most states . . . you become a squatter if you're there 29 days or more, depending on the state,"" Massey said. ""We're able to provide an additional layer of protection for them in the event of a squatting situation."" Ashlyn Messier is a writer for Fox News Digital."
