Parents brand school lunches as ‘shocking and disgusting’,Sarah Hooper,"Oct 2, 2024, 6:09pm","Oct 3, 2024, 9:34am","Home,News,UK","We all have memories of what our school meals were like, but not everyone’s were quite like these. Children at Hummersknott Academy in Darlington were served up something unrecognisable that turned out to be a sausage roll and a burger that looked like something had been scraped off the road. The mother of a girl who is at the school was so concerned she asked other people for their thoughts on Facebook. She said: ‘I wanted to get others’ opinions on the quality and quantity of food the kids are getting because this is costing me a fortune and she’s still starving when she gets home!’ Another parent responded: ‘I have higher standards for my dog.’ Another, who spends up to £30 a week on school dinners, said: ‘My son has always come home every day from school and said he is starving. I never understood why and always just thought he was being greedy or dramatic because surely, I don’t pay that much a month for him to be fed next to nothing. ‘Children need food. How are they going to manage to concentrate in class when they are hungry? It just means they are not at their best learning capabilities; no child should be at such a disadvantage to be able to get a substantial meal.’  However, what shocked her the most, she said was that her son considered the images of the food as ‘the better options’ available at school. She added: ‘If we as adults got fed that food in any establishment it would not be acceptable, so I don’t know why we allow this and still have to pay for food like that.’ Several parents have also commented saying their children had received mouldy food. One mother recalled that her child was given a mouldy brownie on the first day back at school. Another mum commented: ‘That all looks dire! Where’s the healthy options? Where’s the salad in the burger? Awful. Schools bang on about healthy lifestyles and healthy food choices yet serve this!’ The school has now acknowledged and accepted that an incident did occur with a supplier causing the issues to the school dinners but believes a high standard is maintained overall. Northern Lights put on spectacular display above UK - will we see them again tonight? 'I saved £1.85 on a train ticket - now I might end up with a criminal record' Captain Tom's daughter removes listing of £2,250,000 home from prying eyes Daughter's startling confession to police who turned up to check on her parents James Keating, Executive Principal at Hummersknott Academy, said: ‘Catering at Hummersknott Academy is delivered by our in-house teams and we are confident that, overall, a high standard is maintained. ‘However, there was an isolated issue with a supplier at the beginning of the school year that was rectified immediately. As in every other aspect of school life at Hummersknott Academy, we are always looking at ways to improve and we place great importance on feedback from pupils and parents as part of that process. ‘As a result of those regular discussions, we are extending our catering offer to include fresh made-to-order sandwiches and salads, plus a new hot food offer.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

Heinz makes ‘cheeky’ change to baked Beanz that solves a common problem,Jessica Hamilton,"Oct 3, 2024, 11:37am","Oct 3, 2024, 11:46am","Home,Lifestyle,Food","Heinz has launched a new solution to a long-standing problem for baked bean lovers: getting the last few beans out of the tin. Brits have long resorted to shaking the tin aggressively or using a spoon to save the last remnants, but Heinz has introduced a simple fix, storing the tin upside down. The ‘cheeky’ limited-edition £1.40 ‘Beanz Means Upside Down’ tin was designed to ensure beans ‘slip out with ease’ on opening. Featuring new upside-down labels, Heinz is encouraging customers to store their cans ring-pull side down in their cupboards. A survey of 2,000 people by the company found that 87% of Brits will go to ‘extraordinary lengths’ to make sure every last bean ends up on their plate. Nearly seven in 10 (68%) admit to scraping the bottom of the tin with a spoon, while a determined third (33%) resort to shaking the tin furiously in hopes of dislodging those last few beans. Leading food scientist Professor Charles Spence of the University of Oxford explained that storing the tin upside down would make it easier to empty as gravity would dislodge the beans. Professor Spence said: ‘Caused by the cylindrical shape and narrow opening of Heinz Beanz tins, the beans become trapped in unreachable angles, only made more difficult due to the thick sauce that is distinctively Heinz. ‘However, when stored upside down, the beans don’t settle at the ‘bottom’ of the tin, making it easier to enjoy every last bean!’ The simple fix has been the solution ‘Brits have bean crying out for’, according to Heinz, with 30% of Brits admitting they get frustrated when their beans won’t budge and a further 39% recognising the benefits of storing tins upside down. Alessandra de Dreuille, Heinz’s director of meals, said: ‘We go all in to make the best tasting baked beans in Britain – from sourcing beans that are brimming with goodness, to making our rich and thick sauce. ‘So, it’s no wonder our customers go to irrational lengths to enjoy every single bean from their tin. But there is a simple solve! We hope our upside-down label makes more people aware of the hack and they continue to store their beans upside down even after this limited-edition release runs out because they’re too good to leave behind.’ For those wanting to get their hands on a limited-edition Heinz Beanz Meanz Upside Down tin, they’re available at heinztohome.co.uk/upside-beanz.list. It follows the company releasing a controversial new product last month – tinned Spaghetti Carbonara. McDonald’s just launched the ultimate adult Happy Meal and it's a millennial dream McDonald's is finally bringing back iconic item Brits have been craving for last 9 years I'm a drinks expert and these are the best red wines for under a tenner One of the UK's most popular beers is set to return to British pubs after almost 30 years The product, described as ‘pasta in a creamy sauce with pancetta’ allows customers to de-tin their dinner and heat it in minutes. Yet not everyone is impressed with the new invention – least of all Italians. Massimiliano Basso of The Venetian Italian Wine Bar and Restaurant Chester previously told Metro: ‘While I appreciate the effort Heinz has gone to in canning Italian culture and making it suitable for a new generation, sometimes progress for the sake of progress must be discouraged.’ Social media users referred to it as an ‘abomination’ – apologising to Italians worldwide for the creation.

Man who found painting in dump when he was 11 gets very nice payday 13 years later,Mat Winter,"Oct 3, 2024, 6:30am","Oct 3, 2024, 2:44pm","Home,Lifestyle,Money","Logging in to the online auction, I waited patiently for the bids on my painting to start rolling in. Slowly the numbers began creeping up: £1,000, £5,000, even ticking past the £10,000 mark, until finally, the virtual hammer came crashing down. My painting sold for £26,500. Hard to believe that something I found at my local tip 13 years ago could sell for so much money. Ever since I was 10 years old, I’ve had an eye for antiques. Granted, back then it was more a general fascination with interesting looking items than knowing things were of any real value, but still, I was obsessed. I liked the idea of being the person to save things and I even created my own ‘antiques shop’ in my aunt’s garden shed to keep hold of the old stuff I found. Every weekend we’d go to my aunt’s and sometimes I’d go with her when she took her bins down to the tip to look for interesting items others might throw away that could make up stock in my ‘shop’. What started my collection was an old red chopper bike I found there – it was the first thing in my ‘shop’ and I continued to collect items from there, car boot sales and charity shops. But it was when I was 11 years old that I made my best discovery to date. We headed to Cranbrook tip and were joined by about six or seven cars. I watched on as people opened up their car boots revealing their various rubbish bags and unwanted items. And then I saw it – a large picture of an armoured knight on a horse with his dog, riding past a devil and the figure of death. I thought it was cool. Quite boldly for an 11-year-old, I decided to walk straight over to the lady whose car it was in and asked if she was throwing the painting away. When she nodded, I said, ‘Can I have it?’ She might have been shocked, but she mostly seemed delighted to be rid of it. ‘Of course!’ She beamed. ‘You’re welcome to it.’ I then took it back to my shed, had it framed and it took pride of place among my collection. I didn’t really have a plan for it after that, I just had a gut feeling that there was something special about it and that I had to keep it safe. For 12 years it stayed in the shed completely untouched. I’d check on it from time to time but it remained in exactly the same condition as I’d found it – which was pretty much perfect. Then, around 18 months ago, I started having a clear out of my old antiques. I had moved lots from a shed to a lock-up container but storage was expensive. I knew that picture was so special so I decided to get it valued as it deserved to be appreciated have a good home. I went to see the director of Rare Book Auctions in Lichfield, Jim Spencer, to find out more about my painting and to see what it might be worth. When I showed him, he was astonished, practically shaking. Turns out, the painting was an original version of Knight, Death and the Devil painted by a contemporary of Raphael and Leonardo Da Vinci and one of the Renaissance’s most revered artists of all time, Albrecht Dürer. I couldn’t quite believe what Jim was telling me. In fact it wasn’t until after he took it to the British Museum to be authenticated by experts that I dared to even dream he was right. But, as he predicted, they confirmed that my painting was a genuine, 500-year-old engraving. Then in September 2024 it went up for auction and, to my disbelief, sold for almost £27,000. Jim said it’s one of the most important prints he’s ever offered for sale and it could have sold for even more if it had not been previously mounted 100 years ago. Still, I was not disappointed with the result. A German collector – who will pay £33,390 with a buyer’s premium – was the winning bidder and that makes me feel really happy. Dürer was German so you could say, in some ways, it’s going home. To think that I found it at the tip, that it was going to be discarded like rubbish, is mad to me now. Sure, I took it home as part of a childhood hobby, but if I hadn’t, then an important part of history would be lost forever and that’s a sad thought to have. Painting hanging in living room for decades turns out to be £5,000,000 Picasso I legally changed my name to Bond, James Bond aged 49 I’ve been fired 14 times in 8 years for something I can't control A child needed a ventilator, then we found maggots in his throat I plan to put the money from the painting sale towards a new car – though it won’t be the Rolls Royce I dream of owning. Although I can’t hunt for antiques as often as I did as a child. I’ve still always got my eye open. I don’t expect to make that amount of money every time, but you never know what you might find.

The role you’re applying for might be a ‘ghost job’ — here’s how to spot the warning signs,Courtney Pochin,"Oct 3, 2024, 6:00am","Oct 3, 2024, 11:27am","Home,Lifestyle","Applying for a job can be a truly humbling experience, but there’s nothing worse than spending time submitting all your information, only to discover the position’s already been filled. Perhaps you make it through to the interview stage, only to be told (after getting your hopes up) that you did great, but they had an internal candidate lined up for the position all along. Or you might apply for your dream job and get no response whatsoever — no feedback, no rejection, just complete and utter radio silence. These kinds of roles are what have become known as ‘ghost jobs’ and there are several reasons why a company might create a fake listing like this. So as we’ve ascertained, a ghost job is a position that is advertised but doesn’t actually need to be filled. One of the main reasons for posting a listing like this is that the company has a person in mind for a job already, but they aren’t able to just hand the role to them without jumping through some hoops. Many organisations will have strict recruitment regulations that need to be adhered to, including advertising any job openings online — even if it is just a formality. Alternatively, the job advert might have been completely fake all along. There may never have even been a role that needed to be filled, and the advert was simply shared by a recruitment team as a ruse to gather a pool of potential candidates for any future openings that come up. The final reason these types of listings go up is pretty grim, according to Peter Duris, the CEO and co-founder of Kickresume ‘In what is probably the worst-case scenario, job posts are used to make overworked employees believe help is coming or to pressure them into working harder out of fear of being replaced,’ he tells Metro. Falling for a ghost job listing is disheartening. You might feel like you’ve wasted your time, or lost out on a ‘dream’ opportunity, even if it didn’t really exist. Thankfully, there are a few warning signs you can look out for when browsing job boards and recruitment sites such as LinkedIn, according to Peter. He says: ‘Job boards are an easy way to see who’s hiring right now — but sometimes companies post ‘ghost’ listings they don’t plan to fill — or that don’t even exist. Companies should be mindful of this practice, as posting fake jobs can make job seekers lose trust in them.’ He claims the easiest way to spot a ghost job is to take a look at when the listing was posted. If there’s no clear timestamp on it, or if it was posted months ago, it’s worth being cautious. Even a job ad posted more than 30 days ago could be a red flag. ‘Most roles get filled much faster than that,’ Peter explains. ‘Usually, the hiring manager might’ve just forgotten to remove it. However, sometimes it’s left up intentionally. You might also see the job on Indeed or another search site, but not on the company’s own website. I know how hard it is to rejoin the workforce - it took me 20 years The UK's happiest and unhappiest jobs revealed – see if yours made the list Five steps to help you finally achieve a healthy work-life balance I’m a female pilot but I get mistaken for cabin crew every single day ‘If you’re unsure about a listing, it’s always a good idea to reach out to the company directly by email or phone to ask if the role is still open. Talking to someone at the company can help you find out how serious they are about hiring right now.’ Other signs to look out for include vague job descriptions that are missing important details or information like the salary, or the location. A broad salary range could also be a clue. Peter adds: ‘If the listing is older than a month, it is a good sign that the role has already been filled. Most job boards allow you to filter for recent postings to avoid these. Also, if you see the same job reposted often, there might be an issue with the company or the role. ‘You can always check reviews on sites like Indeed or Glassdoor. You might find former employees’ feedback on ghost jobs or hiring promises that never materialise.’ Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.

Inside the ‘mesmerising’ McDonald’s restaurant that hosts late night DJ sets until 4am,Courtney Pochin,"Oct 3, 2024, 2:19pm","Oct 4, 2024, 9:24am","Home,Lifestyle,Food","A trip to Maccies is all about ease and speed — you can be chowing down on fries, some nuggets and maybe a McFlurry, in mere moments. But it turns out, a visit to the fast food chain can be so much more. Well, at least it can if you live in Budapest. That’s because a McDonald’s restaurant in the city, which has been hailed the world’s most beautiful, has launched a rather unique series of late night DJ sets, so you can now grab a Big Mac and boogie on down. The restaurant at Nyugati Railway Station recently re-opened after undergoing an eight-month refurbishment, and to celebrate being back they’ve launched a special new Nyugati Lounge music programme. DJ live lounge at McDonald’s? This is something to experience while waiting for your big tasty 💃🏻🎉🎊 #budapest #mcdonalds #djset #lightshow Taking place on Friday and Saturday nights each week, the immersive events see the grand colonial ceiling of the McDonald’s restaurant transform with ‘mesmerising’ light paintings. These depict everything from a journey through space, or the jungle, to fish swimming in the depths of the ocean. As well as the impressive spectacle, there are also DJs spinning the decks live between 10pm and 4am, playing music as you grab a bite before or after a night out. The unique events will be running until the end of the year, and some of the acts that have already performed include Lauer, Bela Galik, and Nigel Sorter. Photos and videos of the unique McDonald’s experience have gone viral online, with one TikTok by @budapest_insider garnering more than 98,500 likes. In the comments people were quick to say it looked ‘cool’, ‘amazing’, ‘incredible’ and ‘awesome’, while others were desperate to visit. But even if you can’t make it to the capital of Hungary before the end of 2024, the stunning McDonald’s restaurant is still worth a visit for fast food fans even without the DJs. McDonald’s might boast over 35,000 restaurants in over 100 countries across the globe, but Lonely Planet has described this one as the ‘most elegant’. Originally opened in 1990 in a historic building designed by the Gustave Eiffel Company — years before they completed the eponymous Eiffel Tower — this iconic location has long been admired for its architectural grandeur.

We found Budapest a very beautiful city, and this McD’s emphasised that beauty.’ Another, onepolarbear, wrote: ‘The interior is absolutely beautiful and looks more like a restaurant in a 5-star hotel.’ While elindoo added: ‘I’ve been to a lot of Micky D’s around the word but this one takes the cake! I’ve never seen anything like it, not even close.’ Inside you’ll find antique lamps, intricately painted stucco ceilings, plus several new features including a food conveyor belt that allows customers to see their food being transferred between the two levels of the kitchen through a glass box.

New planet discovered orbiting a star close to Earth,Hiyah Zaidi,"Oct 2, 2024, 2:18pm",,"Home,News,Tech","Astronomers have discovered a planet orbiting the closest solo star to Earth. The solo star, which is known as Barnard’s star, is a red dwarf which is around 80% smaller than our sun and sits around six light years away from our solar system. The newly discovered planet, dubbed Barnard b, has half the mass of Venus, and a year on it lasts slightly more than three Earth days. The astronomers published their findings in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. Using the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (ESO’s VLT), the researchers also suggest that there could be three more exoplanets that orbit the star. However, the researchers are sure there is no life on Barnard b as it sits twenty times closer to Barnard’s star than Mercury is to the Sun, and therefore has a surface temperature of a blisteringly hot 125°C. Despite Barnard’s star being the single closest solo star to us, the exoplanet is not the closest one to Earth. The closest stellar system to Earth is the three star group of Alpha Centauri, which hosts the planet Proxima Centauri b and is around four light years away. Researchers were excited to find this planet, as no planet orbiting Barnard’s star has been discovered until now – and due to its proximity to Earth, it is a primary target in the search for Earth-like exoplanets. The team are particularly interested in rocky worlds in the habitable zone around this close star. This region, also known as the ‘Goldilocks zone’, is special because it is the area around a star that is neither too hot nor too cold for water to exist on an orbiting planet without boiling away or freezing. And if there is liquid water, among other things, there may be life. Barnard b was discovered as a result of observations made over five years using the VLT, which is located in Chile. Using a highly precise instrument called ESPRESSO (the Echelle Spectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations), the team measured the wobble of a star which is caused by the gravitational pull of one more orbiting planets to find Barnard b. Then, when the researchers thought they had found something, they confirmed their findings by using data from the exoplanet-hunting High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS). The researchers were looking for signals from possible exoplanets within the habitable or temperate zone of Barnard’s star, which is the range where liquid water can exist on the planet’s surface. Red dwarfs like Barnard’s star are often targeted by astronomers since low-mass rocky planets are easier to detect there than around larger Sun-like stars. Lead author Dr Jonay González Hernández said: ‘Even if it took a long time, we were always confident that we could find something. ‘Barnard b is one of the lowest-mass exoplanets known and one of the few known with a mass less than that of Earth. But the planet is too close to the host star, closer than the habitable zone.

So what’s next? Co-author Dr Alejandro Suárez Mascareño said: ‘We now need to continue observing this star to confirm the other candidate signals. ‘But the discovery of this planet, along with other previous discoveries such as Proxima b and d, shows that our cosmic backyard is full of low-mass planets.’ MORE : SpaceX capsule to rescue stranded astronauts docks at ISS – what happens next?
