It was initially thought there had been a “serious collision” at junction 9 on the M65 near Burnley at around 3.40am. Police though later confirmed only one vehicle, a Seat Ibiza, was involved while two other cars had stopped to help. No further details of exactly what happened have so far been released. Lancashire Police said the girl was a passenger and was pronounced dead in hospital. The male driver, also 17, and two girls aged 17 and 19, were seriously injured and remain in hospital. All the teenagers are from the Darwen area. The motorway was closed for several hours but has since reopened and cops are continuing to appeal for witnesses. Det Sgt Martin Wilcock, of the Road Policing Unit, said: “Very sadly a young girl has lost her life and three other young people have been very badly injured and my thoughts are with the loved ones of all of those involved."" ""Our investigation is ongoing into the circumstances, and I would appeal to anyone who either saw what happened or who has any dashcam or mobile footage to get in touch."" MP for Burnley Oliver Ryan said: “My thoughts are first and foremost with the family and loved ones of the person who has lost their life. I'm truly sorry for your loss. ""My sincere best wishes for a quick recovery are with those injured, and they remain in my thoughts at this distressing time. ""Lastly, while this is an evolving situation, I would like to thank all our emergency services, responding to these incidents is never easy and I know you always do your utmost to keep us safe.” National Highways said: ""The M65 in Lancashire is closed in both directions between J8 (Hapton) and J10 (Burnley) due to a serious road traffic collision.

Inside £225m crime empire of Evil Corp family who rob Brits while flaunting Lamborghini with ‘Thief’ plate & pet TIGERS,"FSB father-in-law ""wrapped arm"" around hacking boss when he was exposed","Grant Rollings, Feature WriterGrant Rollings, Feature Writer","12:13, 3 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","18:55, 3 Oct 2024","News,World News","ONE of the first rules of being a bank robber is to hide your wealth - but the Russian clan accused of stealing hundreds of millions of pounds make a point of flaunting their ill-gotten haul. This week the United Kingdom, United States and Australia sanctioned several members of the same family they believe are cyber hacking money from accounts. But the supposed criminal mastermind Maksim Yakubets, who has a  £3.8million bounty on his head, doesn’t seem to be too worried about being caught. The hacking group the 37-year-old computer geek leads is called Evil Corp and the fluorescent Lamborghini supercar he drives has the word ‘thief’ as a personalised number plate. Members of the gang bringing misery to charities, schools, companies small and large and regular Brits have been photographed posing with piles of cash. They are said to operate out of the basements of cafes in Russia’s capital Moscow and from massive skyscrapers. Will Lyne, Head of Cyber Intelligence at the National Crime Agency (NCA): tells The Sun: “They are probably one of the most significant cybercrime groups of all time.” Sanctions imposed on 16 individuals at the start of this month by Britain and its allies mean they could all be arrested if they leave Russian soil. But here is little chance of President Vladimir Putin putting them in jail, because Evil Corp has links to the brutal dictator’s secret service the FSB. Maksim's father-in-law Eduard Bendersky is a big-game hunter who was part of the shadowy Vympel unit, that carries out assassinations on behalf of the state. Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) believes it was Bendersky who protected Maksim from the Russian authorities when he was identified as the head of Evil Corp five years ago. Will reveals: “The vast majority of criminal groups, particularly Russian cyber criminal groups, are financially motivated, and we don't think that they have these types of connections. “But for Evil Corp in particular, we know that prior to 2019, they undertook taskings on behalf of the Russian state to launch cyber attacks against NATO allies. “We know that Bendersky wrapped his arm around the Evil Corp group after they were disrupted in 2019, to protect them. “He took moves and measures to protect them from internal Russian state investigations and things like that."" They are probably one of the most significant cybercrime groups of all time The Yakubets are believed to have been involved in criminal enterprises prior to turning to hacking. According to an official report into the Evil Corp Ukraine born Maksim’s father Viktor Yakubets “had significant historical ties to money laundering activity.” But it was the tech savvy Maksim who saw a future in cyber crime. The report states: ""Maksim took this family business into the 21st century, branching into cybercrime and bringing his father, brother and cousins along with him. ""By drawing on this family knowledge, Evil Corp became experts in laundering the proceeds of their cybercriminal activities."" Viktor, though, has denied wrongdoing. In 2021 he told the BBC his son was not guilty, commenting: “He was not questioned, he was not interrogated, there were no procedures that would prove his guilt."" Maksim is believed to have started organised hacking in 2007 when he was aged just 20. Operating under the name ‘aqua’, his group's Jabber Zeus malware drained funds directly from the bank accounts of victims. One of the men accused of being involved, Vyacheslav Penchukov, was arrested two years ago in Switzerland. Evil Corp formerly became a crime group in 2014, with the hackers going on group holidays with their wives and girlfriends. A year later their malware known as Dridex is said to have led to £20 million being stolen from the UK alone. Will says: “Some people describe them as mafia-esque, they've got some familial connections, they've been around a long time and they have the head of the OCG (Organised Criminal Group) in terms of Maksim Yakubets. “They probably look a little bit different to what lots of other cyber criminal groups look like nowadays. ""They have been involved in multiple different types of criminal schemes.” Maksim became rich enough to keep tiger and lion cubs and splash out an estimated half a million pounds on his wedding to businesswoman Alyona Benderskaya in the summer of 2017. Footage from the extravagant ceremony at a golf club just north of Moscow saw stunning Alyona float down the aisle in a fairytale white dress - while the groom's face is hidden in every shot. Two years later the US and UK named Maksim as the key player behind the hacking group, considered to be the most prolific in the world. They have targeted 43 countries and stolen at least £225 million from victims globally. Will believes that after the NCA named Maksim as the man behind Evil Corp in 2019, the hackers' operation struggled to operate as effectively. He comments:  “I think it changed the way that they operate, the types of cybercriminal schemes they conduct. ""It didn't stop their operations completely. “It paused them for a period of time. But, when they came back, they operated differently, with a much lower volume of victims, for example.” This week other Evil Corp members were named and sanctioned. They include Maksim’s brother Artem and their father Viktor. His father-in-law Bendersky is also on the list. Bendersky was part of a special ops FSB outfit and reportedly offered to pay nearly £200,000 to have the right to hunt an endangered type of mountain sheep. The investigative website Bellingcat reported that Benderskiy’s Vympel group has carried out several assassinations for the Kremlin overseas. They include the murder of dissident Zelimkhan Khangoshvili in a park in Berlin, Germany, in 2019 by a killer on a bicycle. Bellingcat got hold of phone data which showed that Bendersky was in regular communication with assassin Vadim Krasikov prior to the hit. Will says: “Our information is that he's a former member of the FSB, but obviously he still maintains connections to the Russian state.” The US Treasury also says that Maksim ""provides direct assistance to the Russian government's malicious cyber efforts."" It is these links to the secret services which will make bringing any of the group to justice so difficult. The belief is that while Putin is in power they can act with impunity. There is a video of Maksim doing doughnuts, deliberately skidding his car, around watching police officers. Keeping it in the family, his cousins Kirill and Dmitry Slobodskoy have also been formerly linked to the hacking gang. Another man sanctioned for being part of Evil Corp is Aleksandr Viktorovich Ryzhenkov, 31, from Uzbekistan, who is an old pal of Maksim. Meanwhile 38-year-old Russian Igor Turashev is accused of playing a key role in organising the malware attacks. After the sanction on the gang was announced, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said: “I am making it my personal mission to target the Kremlin with the full arsenal of sanctions at our disposal. “Putin has built a corrupt mafia state with himself at its centre. We must combat this at every turn, and today’s action is just the beginning. “Today’s sanctions send a clear message to the Kremlin that we will not tolerate Russian cyber-attacks - whether from the state itself or from its cyber-criminal ecosystem.”  The sanctions will help restrict the hacking group’s movements and the flow of funds in and out of Russia. Arrests have also been made in Britain of people allegedly involved with LockBit cyber criminals, which is an affiliate of Evil Corp."

Cops launched a manhunt after the chilling attack outside the Westminster Academy in west London at 4.40pm on Monday. A 14-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy were approached outside the school by a lone man who threw a substance at them before fleeing. The girl suffered ""potentially life-changing"" injuries in the attack and has returned to hospital after she was briefly discharged by doctors. A 35-year-old man was arrested this morning on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm following a manhunt. He was taken to a central London police station and remains in custody. The boy's injuries were not as severe as the girl's and he has now been discharged from hospital. A brave member of staff from the school also suffered injuries as she rushed to help the youngsters. Yesterday the girl's dad said: ""My beautiful daughter was the victim of a devastating acid attack outside the Westminster Academy school. ""Words cannot express the shock, pain, and trauma she is going through right now, both physically and emotionally. ""This senseless act of violence has left her with severe injuries that require urgent and long-term medical care, surgeries, rehabilitation, and mental health support."" Detective Superintendent Scott Ware said: ""The investigation team has been working tirelessly to piece together the events. ""Two young victims, aged 16 and 14, were approached outside the school by a lone man who threw a substance at them before fleeing. ""We launched an urgent manhunt to identify and arrest the man responsible for this horrific attack. ""I am pleased to confirm a man was arrested in the early hours of this morning in connection with the incident. ""The 14-year-old girl sustained serious injuries and has returned to hospital having been briefly discharged by doctors. ""It may still be some time before we know the true extent of how serious her injuries are."" DS Ware added: ""At this time they are being treated as potentially life-changing. ""The 16-year-old boy has now been discharged by the hospital and fortunately, his injuries are not as severe as the girl’s. ""A member of staff from the school also sustained injuries as she rushed to the youngsters to provide first aid to them. ""We are aware of the concerns raised by the community and questions being asked about the circumstances surrounding the incident. ""We have been working closely with our key partners to provide support and reassurance to those affected. ""We will maintain a visible policing presence outside the school and will continue to work closely with the school and local authority.""

Three-quarters of parents say their kids only have ‘slim chance’ of having career in creative industry,Experts argue the creative industries need more young talent,"Sophie Warburton, News Reporter","9:41, 3 Oct 2024","15:31, 3 Oct 2024","News,UK News","THREE quarters of parents reckon their kids only have a ‘slim chance’ of making a successful career in a creative industry. A poll of 2,000 mums and dads found 66 per cent like the idea of their children pursuing creative roles such as graphic design, game design or broadcasting. But 73 per cent fear the routes and opportunities into the creative industries can feel too closed off to many. Nearly six in 10 (57 per cent) fear having ‘contacts’ is just as important as qualifications for career advancement. And 84 per cent think ‘it’s not what you know, it’s who you know’, if you want to work in the broadcast and TV industry. While 27 per cent believe in today’s job market, a ‘secure’ career path is more important than following a passion. However, 86 per cent of parents would feel more confident about their child pursuing a creative career if they knew more about the opportunities available. The research was commissioned by the Gatsby Charitable Foundation to raise awareness of T-levels, a two-year, career-focused qualification for 16- to 19-year-olds which is equivalent to three A-levels and includes a 45-day industry placement. Singer, author and TV personality, Alesha Dixon, who is part of the ‘T-team’, said: “The creative industries are absolutely bursting with exciting opportunities for young people, and not just in front of the camera. “There are hundreds of different jobs that provide fulfilling and successful careers, but getting your foot in the door can be challenging, which is why young people need to be given the opportunity to start building up a network of contacts before they’re 18.” The research also found 47 per cent of parents believe the job market favours those with relevant industry experience. And 49 per cent would like to see more internships and work placements in creative fields, while 39 per cent think the value of creative careers should be more widely promoted to society. But 57 per cent admitted they’re worried their child will eventually choose a career path they’d come to regret, according to the OnePoll.com data. TV Presenter and Businesswoman Sara Davies, who is also one of the latest ‘T-team’ recruits, said: “The creative industries need more young talent. “Being able to use creative muscles is beneficial in so many areas of our lives, and the workplace is one of them. “Whether you’re going straight for a career in a creative industry, are creating and designing something to market, or if you need to think differently in a more corporate job, the benefits are so far-reaching.”"

Smoking is ‘out of fashion’ as rates hit record low – but 5million are vaping,"Experts say vaping ""must not be a lifestyle accessory""","Sam Blanchard, Health CorrespondentSam Blanchard, Health Correspondent","13:47, 1 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","17:18, 1 Oct 2024","Health,News Health","SMOKING rates are at a record low in Britain and vaping is now almost equally popular, figures show. The Office for National Statistics classed 11.9 per cent of UK adults as cigarette smokers last year - about six million people. It is the lowest since records began in 1974, when the figure was nearly half. Fags are now especially uncool with young people, it found, with under-25s now less than half as likely to smoke as 10 years ago. Rates among youngsters fell from 26 per cent in 2011 to 10 per cent in 2023. It comes as ministers plan a smoking crackdown with a potential ban on sparking up in pub gardens, along with a rising legal age of purchase set out by Rishi Sunak. Paul Rees, chief of the National Pharmacy Association, said: “It is good to see a reduction in levels of smoking. “It remains one of the biggest causes of ill health in our communities.” Smoking tobacco is known to cause at least 16 types of cancer, plus heart diseases and dementia. Hazel Cheeseman, chief executive of campaign group Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), said: “These figures are further proof that the country is ready to be smokefree.” Meanwhile, vaping is riding a wave of popularity with an estimated 5.1million over-16s using e-cigarettes every day or “occasionally” - 9.8 per cent. That compares to 8.7 per cent in 2022. Ex-smokers are most likely to use vapes but there has been a rapid rise in the number of never-smokers who have taken up the habit, to approximately 400,000 people. We need to reinforce the role of vaping as a tool to stop smoking, not a lifestyle accessory Experts are concerned that this trend could lead more young people to smoke who never would have. And although e-cigarettes are almost certainly safer than tobacco, their long-term health impacts are still not well understood. The Government is likely to ban disposable vapes and those that come in brightly coloured devices or have fruity or sweet flavours that appeal to kids. Professor Nick Hopkinson, a lung doctor in London and chair of the ASH campaign group, said: “Vaping has helped millions of adults quit smoking and is much less harmful than smoking. “However, it is not risk-free and high levels of use among young people and growing use among never smokers is a concern.  “The government must get its Tobacco and Vapes Bill into law as soon as possible. “We need to reinforce the role of vaping as a tool to stop smoking, not a lifestyle accessory.” VAPING has been touted as an effective tool to help people quit smoking. Though vaping is substantially less harmful than smoking, the habit isn't completely harmless and comes with its own set of risks. The NHS only recommends it for adult smokers, to support quitting smoking. GP and author Dr Philippa Kaye explained to The Sun that the differences between vaping and smoking - and whether one is better than the other - is ""complicated"". ""In a nutshell, vaping is better than smoking, but breathing air is better than vaping at all."" Vaping exposes users to far fewer toxins - and at lower levels - than smoking cigarettes. Switching to vaping significantly reduces your exposure to toxins that can cause cancer, lung disease, and diseases of the heart and circulation like heart attack and stroke. These diseases are not caused by nicotine, which is relatively harmless to health. But research has still linked vaping to a higher risk of failure and lung disease.

Paul O’Grady’s huge countryside mansion with pool and ‘witch’s cottage’ goes on sale for £3.5m after row with neighbours,Paul's ballet dancer husband Andre Portasio had been given the green light to turn part of the estate into a holiday let,"Shan Ally, Showbiz ReporterShan Ally, Showbiz Reporter","11:40, 3 Oct 2024Published: Invalid Date,","14:19, 3 Oct 2024","Showbiz,Celebrity","PAUL O’Grady’s huge countryside mansion has gone on sale for £3.5m - and comes with a ""witch's cottage"". The much-loved TV presenter, who died last year aged 67, lived in the seven-bedroom farmhouse in Kent with husband Andre Portasio. In June, The Sun revealed Brazilian ballet dancer Andre had lost his battle with neighbours to turn a security hut at their home into a separate two-bedroom house THREE times bigger. However, he was later granted permission to turn it into a holiday let instead. Eighteen months on from Paul's death, the property is now on the market. It was listed on Rightmove last Thursday and will likely attract a lot of interest. The house boasts four reception rooms, a large kitchen and breakfast room and a master bedroom with dressing room and en suite. It also has four further bedrooms with an en suite and a modern family bathroom. A cottage on the grounds has been turned into a dance studio and gym with a kitchen and steam room. A second timber cottage is described as a ""charming and whimsical building ... where carved woodland creatures keep watch and fairy doors are accommodated"". Outdoors is equally as spectacular, with a swimming pool, a barn, stables, orchard and paddocks. The 1910 mansion surrounded by woodland is listed for £3.5m. Four years ago, Lily Savage star Paul was given the go-ahead for a groundkeeper's outbuilding, gym and dance studio at his rural estate. But following his death last year, his widower inherited the estate and launched a bid to turn the security hut into a separate two-bedroom house. He applied to the local council for a ""change of use"" of the security lodge which has an office, kitchen and shower, and lies next to the family pet cemetery. But neighbours blasted his plans and accused him of trying to build a new home ""by the back door"". In a letter of objection, a neighbour said: ""The present application is in direct contravention of the original planning conditions and in my view amounts to an attempt to gain planning permission for a significant residential development by the back door, and one which will no doubt be sold on separately to the main building. ""Given that the estate is very large, there surely must still be a need for a groundskeeper and gardeners and, indeed, for the workshop that was constructed for them."" Andre later applied to transform the lodge into a holiday let and received the go-ahead by Ashford Council. Planning officer Sally Hodgson said: ""Central government guidance supports sustainable business, enterprise and tourism in rural areas, both through the conversion of existing buildings and well-designed new buildings. ""This is endorsed by the Local Plan which seeks to encourage the sustainable growth of tourism."" For the Love of Dogs presenter Paul bought the seven-bedroom farmhouse for £650,000 in 1999. The sprawling 50-acre estate lies in a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and also comes with four acres of woodland in the so-called Garden of England, where past and present neighbours include comedians Julian Clary and Alan Carr. Paul passed away at the home in March 2023 due to sudden cardiac arrhythmia.  He had previously suffered two heart attacks. Paul and Andre tied the knot in 2017 after first getting together in 2006."
