Volvo reverses plan to sell only electric cars by 2030 as demand falls,Tina Teng,"05/09/2024,9:30 GMT+2",Business,Volvo Cars has abandoned its plan to become a fully electric car manufacturer by 2030 due to weakening consumer demand for pure electric vehicles. This shift marks the latest change among major car manufacturers.,"The Swedish automaker Volvo Cars has abandoned its plan to exclusively sell electric vehicles by 2030 due to softening demand for pure battery-powered cars. Following the announcement on Wednesday, Volvo's shares fell by more than 4% and have declined by 12% over the past six months. The company also reported disappointing earnings for the first quarter and provided weak guidance during its second-quarter earnings call. Instead of aiming to become a fully electric car manufacturer, Volvo is now targeting “90 to 100 per cent of its global sales volume by 2030 to consist of electrified cars,” which includes a mix of fully electric and plug-in hybrid models. The remaining 0-10 per cent will allow for a limited number of mild hybrid models, if necessary. Volvo still expects to produce 50 to 60 per cent electrified vehicles by the middle of this decade, which would position it to become a fully electric carmaker when “conditions are suitable.” The company noted that 26 per cent of its products are fully electric cars, the highest share among its premium competitors. Its total electrified share, including EVs and plug-in hybrids, accounted for 48% in the second quarter of this year. The growing demand for hybrid vehicles and the decreasing affordability of pure electric cars have been putting pressure on electric carmakers' profit margins. The renowned EV maker Tesla has seen a continued decline in profit margins and slowing growth since 2023. CEO Elon Musk has indicated a shift in consumer preference from 100% electric cars to hybrid vehicles. Amid sluggish consumer demand and a price war in China, automakers are facing macroeconomic headwinds. The industry is also experiencing uncertainties due to new import tariffs on Chinese-made EVs imposed by the EU and the US, with China pledging reciprocal measures. “It is clear that the transition to electrification will not be linear, and customers and markets are moving at different speeds of adoption,” Volvo stated. “We are pragmatic and flexible while retaining an industry-leading position on electrification and sustainability.” Government subsidies for renewable energy vehicles have previously incentivised consumers to buy fully electric cars. However, with these incentives expiring and falling crude oil prices, the appeal of owning a fully electrified vehicle has diminished. Volvo noted, “The slower-than-expected rollout of charging infrastructure, withdrawal of government incentives in some markets, and additional uncertainties created by recent tariffs on EVs in various markets. With this in mind, Volvo Cars continues to see the need for stronger and more stable government policies to support the transition to electrification.” Volvo Cars, owned by China’s Geely, is the latest major car manufacturer to scale back its ambitious plans for a purely electric vehicle transition, though it remains committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. In July, Luca De Meo, CEO of French automaker Renault, warned that customers are not yet ready to switch to battery-powered vehicles. He called for more flexibility in the schedule, referring to Europe’s green energy transition and the target to shift to EVs by 2035. German luxury carmaker Porsche also scaled back its target of selling 80% fully electric vehicles. Other mainstream car manufacturers, including Ford and Fiat, have also expressed concerns that EV-only plans by 2030 may be over-ambitious."""
UK house prices hit two-year high after 'positive summer' for market,Indrabati Lahiri,"06/09/2024,13:17 GMT+213:43",Economy,The August Halifax House Price Index also revealed which parts of the UK are seeing the most growth in house prices and what the average property price is in various areas across the country.,"The year-on-year UK Halifax House Price Index for August was released on Friday, coming in at 4.3%, which was the largest jump since November 2022, according to Halifax and Bank of Scotland. This was also considerably more than the 2.4% seen in July, as well as a notch above analyst expectations of 4.2%. However, this higher figure is also in part due to the weaker house prices seen last year, making the reversal to growth even more marked. As of August, a typical property would cost a buyer £292,505, which is the highest price since August 2022 and slightly higher than July’s £291,585. Month-on-month house prices inched up 0.3% in August, down from the 0.9% seen in July, but still above market forecasts of 0.2%. Northern Ireland experienced the strongest growth in property prices in the UK, with a year-on-year surge of 9.8% in August. Wales recorded house prices rising 5.5% compared to last year, whereas Scotland saw a more subdued growth of 1.7% this year. London also saw housing prices inch up 1.5%. In August, the average property price in Wales was £224,433, while Northern Ireland houses are likely to cost buyers £201,043. Scottish properties retailed at an average of £205,144, while London properties continued to be the most expensive at £536,056. Amanda Bryden, head of mortgages at Halifax, said: “Recent price rises build on a largely positive summer for the UK housing market. Prospective homebuyers are feeling more confident thanks to easing interest rates. That optimism is reflected in the latest mortgage approval figures, now at their highest level in almost two years. “Such has been the resilience of house prices that the average property is now just £1,000 shy of the record high set in June 2022 (£293,507). While this is welcome news for existing homeowners, affordability remains a significant challenge for many potential buyers still adjusting to higher mortgage costs. “However, with market activity picking up and the possibility of further interest rate reductions to come, we expect house prices to continue their modest growth through the remainder of the year.” Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at online investment service Bestinvest by Evelyn Partners, said in an email note: “Strong demand for properties is being matched by a surge in listings as sellers, previously sitting on the sidelines as they waited for market conditions to improve, are now making a move. “Providing the economy continues its recovery, with robust economic growth recorded in the first half of the year and inflation falling to more palatable levels, housing market activity is expected to continue strengthening in line with easing affordability levels. “That’s not to say that an expected uplift in inflation in the final few months of the year on the back of rising energy prices or a potential slowdown in the pace of interest rate cuts won’t create a few stumbling blocks along the way.” The next Bank of England (BoE) interest rate decision will be announced on 19 September. In August, the BoE chose to cut interest rates by 0.25% to 5%, with the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voting 5-4 in favour of the rate cut. For the housing market, the direction of these interest rate directions are particularly important, with higher interest rates likely to lead to less borrowing, because of increased mortgage rates. In turn, this can lead to a slow and lacklustre housing market. On the other hand, falling interest rates can boost interest in the housing market by making borrowing cheaper for individuals and companies alike. Although the Bank of England has taken a much more hawkish stance than other major central banks such as the US Federal Reserve, it is still expected to deliver at least one more rate cut by the end of this year. If so, this may go a long way in supporting growth within the UK housing market. Haine noted: “With the housing market generally in better shape than it was little over a year ago when mortgage rates were still alarmingly high, all eyes will be pinned on the next interest rate decision later this month. The good news is that many major lenders have already begun trimming their headline deals. “While another UK rate decision is expected before the year is out - though potentially not as early as this month - something that would improve mortgage rates for new borrowers and those on trackers, it won’t ease the concerns for those locked into fixed rate deals with some time left to run. “Those on long-term fixes taken out before or during the early stages of the BoE’s rate-hiking cycle are still likely to face a jump in repayments when they eventually come to refinance.” "
Digital Twin of the Ocean: Europe’s game-changer for sustainable seas,Denis Loctier,"24/09/2024,15:00 GMT+218:22",Ocean,Our understanding of the world's oceans is set for a quantum leap thanks to artificial intelligence and digital technologies. At the forefront of this revolution is a the EU-funded Digital Twin of the Ocean project.,"Artificial intelligence and other new technologies are promising to revolutionise our understanding of the ocean in the coming years. But the crucial element is data, and there’s an entire ocean of it to collect and process. To find out more, Euronews' Denis Loctier travelled to the Adriatic and the North Sea, where he met some of the many scientists gathering data helping to build EU's groundbreaking Digital Twin of the Ocean project. Just off the coast near Miramare Castle in Trieste, bright yellow buoys mark a coastal observatory — part of Italy’s Long-Term Ecological Research Network. Since 1986, scientists have returned to this exact spot every month to collect water samples and take various measurements, building a long-term series of scientific data that reflects changes in the coastal environment over the years. Among them is Bruno Cataletto, a marine biologist at the National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics. “We’re conducting chemical analyses, measuring nutrient levels, salinity, chlorophyll, and biological parameters. We’ll also collect samples of phytoplankton and microzooplankton and analyze them later today in the lab,” he says. Scientists publish the collected data in online databases, making it freely accessible to marine industries like fishing. Some of these databases are quite comprehensive, even including reports from citizen scientists. Researcher Valentina Tirelli developed a free app called ""avvistAPP,"" allowing anyone with a smartphone to report sightings of marine life, such as jellyfish, dolphins, sea turtles and alien species like the blue crab. “When citizens send in their observations, we validate them,"" Tirelli says. ""This combination of citizen data and researcher verification creates reliable information. This open-access data is available in the EMODNet Biology database, free for everyone to use.” EMODnet,  the European Marine Observation and Data Network, collects and shares data from across Europe. But manually processing samples, like counting plankton under microscopes, becomes increasingly challenging. Artificial intelligence is set to greatly accelerate this process, redefining what is possible with marine databases. From Italy’s Adriatic Sea, we move to Belgium’s North Sea coast. At the Marine Station Ostend, researchers from the Flanders Marine Institute are already using digital cameras and AI to accelerate plankton identification. What once took a full day in the lab now takes just 30 minutes. “We have AI models that are trained on our specific images that have learned to recognise all these species,"" says Rune Lagaisse, a plankton ecologist at the VLIZ Flanders Marine Institute. ""And so in a matter of minutes we can actually analyse a sample, get a full species list and it saves us a lot of time and money,” she adds. And instead of monthly samplings, marine data can now be collected digitally around the clock. We took a trip aboard the Belgian research vessel Simon Stevin to meet the scientists making this possible with autonomous underwater platforms equipped with various sensors. Klaas Deneudt leads the European-funded project DTO-BioFlow, which develops common standards to feed all types of data into the massive databases of tomorrow. “What we really need is continuous data over time. We need to really take the pulse of the seas and know what is going on at each and every minute,” he tells us. A remote signal releases the underwater buoy, bringing valuable acoustic recordings to the surface. Researchers collect these recordings from various locations across the Belgian North Sea. One practical use is monitoring the presence of harbour porpoises — small marine mammals that play a crucial role as top predators in the local ecosystem. These animals produce sounds beyond human hearing, but AI algorithms can detect them in the recordings, allowing researchers to map their movements throughout the year. This data can help noisy industries, such as offshore wind, plan their activities to minimise disturbances to marine porpoises. “Over winter time, they are mostly present,"" observes Elisabeth Debusschere, a bio-acoustician at the VLIZ Flanders Marine Institute. ""And then over summer, they are less present in Belgian waters. So that's quite interesting. It could also be interesting for the offshore industry to plan their activities.“ In the near future, all these continuous data streams will converge in a groundbreaking project — the Digital Twin of the Ocean. Its core infrastructure, developed through the EU-funded EDITO-Infra project, was recently unveiled at an event in Brussels. “The Digital Twin of the ocean is a digital replica of the ocean inside your computer,"" explains Alain Arnaud, Head of Digital Ocean at Mercator Ocean International. ""It's a place where you could gather all the information you can have on the ocean, and you made that available for the general public, and for all the scientists and decision makers.” By integrating various data types, this virtual model can become a powerful tool for solving complex problems. Simon van Gennip from Mercator Ocean International, a non-profit (transitioning into an intergovernmental organisation) that co-develops the digital twin, showed how it can be used to address plastic pollution. “Since the 1990s, we know all the currents in the ocean at global scale, and for every day,"" van Gennip says. ""It's a treasure, because we can use it to virtually deploy particles where we think they enter the ocean from the coast. And then we can say, well, where does this virtual plastic particle, where is it transported by the currents the next day, and so forth. And then eventually we can get an idea of how plastic gets transported in the ocean. And so that's what we can do thanks to model that we cannot obtain from observations we don't have.” Another application, presented by Kelli Johnson from the German research institute Hereon, focuses on finding the most effective ways to restore seagrass meadows. “What we're looking at with the Digital Twin of the Ocean is the ability to plug in the data to simulate this"",- the researcher says. ""If the seagrass beds and meadows were to be bigger, if they were to be, for example, planted at certain depths in order to see the impact that seagrass meadows, for example, could have on coastal resilience and impacting wave heights and coastal erosion, which we have found already some very interesting results that they do impact these things. And so, it's very important for us to be able to test this out.” The Digital Twin of the Ocean promises to be a game-changer for policymakers. It will allow them to model different sea-use scenarios and test their realistic outcomes before making decisions. Kestutis Sadauskas, Deputy Director-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries at the European Commission, outlines the potential benefits: “How do we sustainably use the ocean? Because we still need to fish, we need to produce electricity from the ocean energy, we we need to do shipping, we need to lay the cables. We need to enjoy ourselves as tourists there... It will be cheaper to make the decisions, and to make more correct decisions with less mistakes if we try to model it before we go out in real life,”- he says. From underwater sensors to satellite observations and citizen reports, all this data will merge in the Digital Twin. “We want to make sustainable use of this great resource that we call the ocean,""- stresses Klaas Deneudt. ""We can only do that if we work together with different countries surrounding the seas, putting all the data that we have together and making it easily accessible.” Once fully launched, the European Digital Twin of the Ocean will make a wealth of ocean data freely available — giving researchers, policymakers, businesses and citizens a futuristic new tool to benefit from the ocean sustainably."
Worth its salt: Can desalination help address Europe's freshwater needs?,Euronews,"01/10/2024,15:00 GMT+2",Water Matters,"The process of desalination has been around for centuries, but has had only limited success in providing freshwater for humans. The EU is exploring ways to make it a viable solution to future water shortages.","Desalination is the process of removing salt from seawater or brackish water to make it useable for people in a range of purposes, including drinking. It is seen as a drought-proof alternative to water supplies threatened by climate change. Several southern EU countries rely on it to provide freshwater, for drinking and agriculture. But desalination plants are expensive to build and run, and use a lot of energy, although new technologies are reducing costs and the environmental impact. They can also have an adverse environmental impact on marine animals and plants. Desalination produces a byproduct called brine - a concentrated salt solution with chemicals. When discharged back into the sea it can harm fish, coral and plankton. Many consider desalination a ‘last resort’, only to be used once all other options such as reusing wastewater and reducing leaks have been tried. But while the technology has significant drawbacks, without it, some EU regions would not be able to meet their water demands. Desalination is already widely used in Spain, Cyprus and Portugal. Greece and Italy are expanding too. In some regions of Europe we won’t be able to meet demand fully unless we both reuse wastewater and desalinate some sea water. ·         The latest update of the Taxonomy Regulation (a cornerstone of the EU’s sustainable finance framework and an important market transparency tool) classifies desalination as a “green” investment under strict conditions related to environmental aspects. Green energy should be used as much as possible and brine must be reduced and in case of discharges must be safely treated and diluted in sea water. ·     Desalination has drawbacks, including high energy consumption and maintenance, and disposal of the brine. New desalination plants should come after a major effort to protect and restore the water cycle, and ensure the efficient use of water, by encouraging reuse, reducing water leakages, cutting abstractions and so on. Desalination should be undertaken only where environmentally better alternatives are not available and that it must be in the framework of an integrated water management, with a fair balance between water supply and demand. ·         Desalination is emerging in response to water shortages, especially in Mediterranean countries, often in combination with wastewater reuse and increased efficiency. ·         Several southern EU countries are using desalination to help cover freshwater needs. Yet in the EU, a small fraction of freshwater is obtained through seawater desalination. ·         EU facilities can supply up to 2.89 billion m3 of desalted water a year (active capacity). ·         71% of the water produced is used for public water supply (2 billion m3, 4.2% of total water employed in public supply). 17% of the desalinated water produced in the EU is used for industrial applications, 4% in power plants, and 8% for irrigation. ·         EU desalination plants are mainly located in Mediterranean countries: about 1,200 plants provide a capacity of 2.37 billion m3 (82% of total EU desalination capacity) ·         See here for sources for figures above: ·         EU funding into research on desalination totaled €81.5 million from 2014-2019 focused on infrastructural investments and innovation activities. ·         Desalination plants are expensive to build and operate. The price of water produced with desalination is very high. It is therefore mostly used to produce drinking water. ·         It is an energy intensive process, and it is essential that it is done using renewable energy and reducing its energy consumption. ·         Desalination produces a by-product, brine (a concentrated salt solution with chemicals) that must be properly disposed of to avoid adverse impacts on the marine environment. ·         Constructing water intakes and infrastructure such as pipes will also lead to permanent alteration of hydrographical conditions (e.g. change of sediments) and could impact the marine life. ·         The latest update of the Taxonomy Regulation classifies desalination as a “green” investment under strict conditions related to environmental aspects. ·         Desalination projects must meet stringent criteria under the EU Taxonomy, ensuring they contribute to sustainable water use and protection while minimizing environmental impact. ·         Criteria include efficient energy use, low greenhouse gas emissions, and adherence to biodiversity protection measures, aligning with EU goals for climate resilience and environmental sustainability. ·         For more information see here."
One million people in England who never regularly smoked are now vaping,Lauren Chadwick,"03/10/2024,7:00 GMT+2",Health news,A new survey in England found that there’s a sharp increase in the number of non-regular smokers who have taken up vaping.,"One million adults in England who did not regularly smoke have now started vaping, according to new research. The estimates come from a survey published in the Lancet Public Health journal on Thursday and reveal a sevenfold increase in the number of adults who were not regular smokers but have turned to vaping since 2021. This increase is driven by young adults, the study authors said, with 14 per cent of 18 to 24-year-old non-regular smokers now using e-cigarettes. Sarah Jackson, the study’s lead author and a principal research fellow at University College London’s Alcohol and Tobacco Research Group, says the public health impact of the survey results depends on whether these people would have otherwise smoked tobacco. ""It is likely that some would have smoked if vaping were not an available option. In this case, vaping is clearly less harmful,"" Jackson said in a statement. ""However, for those who would not have gone on to smoke, vaping regularly over a sustained period poses more risk than not vaping"". The estimates were based on survey data from more than 153,000 adults in England collected between 2016 and 2024. Around 60 per cent of those surveyed were not regular smokers, meaning they responded that they had never smoked for a year or more. The researchers found that up to 2021, the proportion of adult non-smokers who vaped was stable at 0.5 per cent, but from 2021, this increased to 3.5 per cent. The authors also note that new disposable e-cigarettes became popular in 2020 and 2021 in the UK. Peter Hajek, a professor at Queen Mary University of London who focuses on modifying health behaviour such as tobacco dependence, said in a statement that some people are discovering vaping ""without becoming smokers first"" but that if vaping did not exist they would be smoking. ""If much less risky alternatives are allowed to continue to compete with cigarettes, smoking (and heart disease, lung disease and cancers that it causes) will continue to decline as well,"" said Hajek, who was not involved in the study. The number of people who smoke in the UK has decreased since the 1970s and is currently at around 12.9 per cent. As e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking cigarettes, they’ve been used in the UK as a smoking cessation tool and were the most popular aid for trying to quit in 2020. ""Efforts are needed to limit use of nicotine products in adolescents but if more adults (as well as adolescents) are taking up vaping instead of smoking, it may be in fact good news,"" Hajek added. The survey also found that people who drink more heavily were more likely to vape, something that other research has shown for cigarette smoking as well. In April 2024, the authors estimate that the prevalence of vaping among heavy drinkers was around 22 per cent compared to it being at 3 per cent for those drinking at low levels and 1.3 per cent for those who do not drink. Overall, the new study found that people who vape who were not previously regular smokers tended to be younger, women, and heavier drinkers. These groups were more likely to use disposable devices and high-strength nicotine e-liquids. The authors also say the question remains whether or not those who are currently vaping would have otherwise been smoking. ""If vaping was only being taken up by people who would otherwise smoke, we would expect the total proportion of adults who either smoke or vape to remain stable or decline,"" the authors wrote in the study’s introduction. But as this proportion has increased, it ""suggests there are now people who would not have otherwise taken up smoking who have started vaping regularly,"" they added. As the UK government considers stricter regulations on e-cigarettes, the situation ""creates a challenge"" on how to strike a balance between minimising vaping among those who wouldn’t have smoked and making sure it’s attractive to those who are using it to quit, the authors wrote. Meanwhile, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said ""vapes can be an effective way for adult smokers to quit, but we have always been clear children and adult non-smokers should not vape""."
"Bright light therapy works for about 40% of depression patients, analysis shows",Gabriela Galvin,"02/10/2024,18:08 GMT+203/10/2024,5:22 GMT+2",Health news,"Bright light therapy is a promising early treatment for patients with non-seasonal depression, a new analysis found.","Bright light therapy, which is sometimes used to treat seasonal affective disorders, also works for people with other types of depression, a new analysis has found. An estimated 40 per cent of patients with depression responded to bright light therapy (BLT), which mimics sunlight, according to the research review published in JAMA Psychiatry. That’s compared with 23 per cent among the control group, which included people who got lower levels of light exposure, antidepressants, or a placebo. BLT has long been recommended for people with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a type of depression that can sap people’s energy or affect their sleep schedule and typically hits during the darker winter months. But the new findings indicate this light therapy could also be helpful for patients with non-seasonal depression. Given an estimated 50 per cent of depression patients don’t respond to initial treatments, the researchers said, they also suggest it could serve as a cheaper first-line therapy. “BLT may be able to serve as [an additional] treatment in several locations around the globe and, consequently, in the more diverse economic environments,” the study authors from Brazilian universities said. Their analysis included nearly 860 patients across 11 studies conducted between 2005 and 2024, and they used light boxes with an intensity of 5,000 to 10,000 lux of light, which is the level of exposure recommended by experts. Across the studies, patients treated with BLT were more likely to respond to treatment and see their depression symptoms subside, and saw a greater reduction in depression scores compared with the control group. BLT patients saw positive results regardless of how long researchers tracked them, the analysis also found. Even so, none of the studies followed patients for longer than a few weeks. ""Our analysis revealed that a treatment duration of one week may be as effective as a six-week duration,"" Artur Menegaz de Almeida, the study’s lead author and a medical student at the Federal University of Mato Grosso (UFMT) in Brazil, told Euronews Health. ""However, this finding requires further investigation to better understand the time-response relationship in bright light therapy"". It’s also not entirely clear why light appears to affect mood, Menegaz de Almeida added. Based on mice studies, researchers think that when light passes through the eyes, it could act as a stimulus for parts of the brain that regulate mood, affect, and the circadian rhythm, or the body’s internal clock. ""Since bright light therapy has been shown to benefit both seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and non-seasonal depressive disorders, it is possible that a similar mechanism is involved,"" Menegaz de Almeida said. He also emphasised that common artificial light may not be strong enough to regulate people’s moods, given ""the light we assessed is not the same as a typical sun-lamp""."
Over 75% of 3 and 4-year-olds in Europe get too much screen time and not enough sleep and exercise,Gabriela Galvin,"30/09/2024,17:52 GMT+2",Health news,"While most young children get enough sleep, they spend too much time on screens and don’t move enough, the global study found.","Three in four young children in Europe get too much screen time and not enough sleep and daily movement, according to a new global analysis. According to international benchmarks, children under 5 should get three hours per day of physical activity, including at least an hour of intense exercise, as well as a maximum of one hour of screen time and 10 to 13 hours of sleep. But across 33 countries globally, just 14.3 per cent of three and four-year-olds meet all of those standards, according to the study published in JAMA Pediatrics, which included about 7,000 children. While 81 per cent get enough sleep, just 41.8 per cent meet screen time recommendations and 49.2 per cent get enough physical activity. Given early childhood is a ""critical window of opportunity"" to establish healthy habits, the findings have serious implications for the ""lifelong health and well-being"" of people around the world, according to the researchers led by the University of Wollongong in Australia. ""It's really important that we look at the extent to which children are meeting these guidelines across different countries,"" Dr Sarah Rose, a developmental psychologist and associate professor at the University of Staffordshire in the United Kingdom, told Euronews Health. She was not involved with the new study. ""This evidence is the sort of thing that we need to hopefully bring about some change for the children"". The rates are slightly better in Africa and Europe, where about a quarter of kids (23.9 and 23.5 per cent, respectively) meet all three benchmarks. Half of European children (50 per cent) have sufficiently limited screen time, while 53.5 per cent of kids get enough exercise, and nearly all of them (94.7 per cent) get enough sleep. Notably, European girls are more likely than boys to meet screen time guidelines, but they are less likely to get enough exercise, the study found. At the regional level, North and South America have both the best and worst habits. While two in three kids get enough physical activity – higher than any other region – children there also have the most screen time by far, with just 17 per cent meeting recommendations. ""Sometimes people make assumptions that if a child is spending lots of time sat in front of the screen, they're not engaging in physical activity, whereas actually this data presents a more nuanced picture than that,"" Rose said. It’s likely that trends in physical activity and screen time start even earlier in life, given previous research shows that just a quarter of children under 2 years old are meeting screen time recommendations. Too much screen time is also linked to health issues. The more time 1-year-olds spend on screens, the more likely they are to have developmental delays when they’re 2 and 4 years old – though it’s not yet clear that the screen time actually causes the problems. Several European nations are pushing for limitations on children’s screen time. In September, Sweden’s public health agency recommended banning screens for kids under 2, following similar guidance in Ireland for babies up to 18 months old. Meanwhile, the French government says kids under 3 should have no screen time, and that up until 6 it should be “strongly limited”. Other countries, such as China, have gone even further by restricting, for example, online games that target young people. Yet screen-time bans may not always be realistic, given digital technology is everywhere in daily life, according to researchers from Lund University in Sweden. After studying the daily digital habits of young children, they concluded that it is ""nearly impossible"" to keep young kids away from screens and that a zero-tolerance approach may simply make parents feel worried or ashamed about their kids’ screen use, rather than help them cut back. Rose also said that screen time guidelines can be overly simplistic, given they typically don't take into account the quality of what kids are doing on their devices. ""Screen time can be such a range of different activities, and those activities can have different values for the children engaged with them,"" Rose said, for example video-calling with grandparents or watching educational TV. ""I think that what parents would really value is supportive guidance about how to use screen time in a healthy way with their children,"" Rose said."
