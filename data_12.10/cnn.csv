Police kill armed man near Israeli consulate in Munich terror attack,"Claudia Otto,Stephanie Halasz,Matthies Otto,CNN","2:21 PM EDT, Thu September 5, 2024",4 minute,"World,Europe","German police shot dead an armed man after a terror attack near the Israeli consulate in central Munich on Thursday, officers said, prompting an investigation by state prosecutors. The suspect – an 18-year-old Austrian citizen – was armed with an older rifle with a mounted bayonet when he was shot on Karolinenplatz, a square near the Israeli consulate and a Nazi documentation center, according to police in Munich. The suspect was fatally injured after shots were exchanged, Munich police said in a post on X. Five officers were involved in the shootout, according to Andreas Franken, a police spokesperson.

      AfD becomes first far-right party to win German state election since 1945 At least 500 personnel were called to the scene in Munich’s city center, Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said. A helicopter was deployed to provide a more detailed assessment of the incident, according to Reuters. There is no indication other suspects may be involved, police added. Authorities assume the attack was planned, Herrmann told reporters on Tuesday. The teenager had parked a car near the scene of the shooting. One unnamed eyewitness told German media that he heard several bullets fired, before police shot the suspect to the ground. “I heard several shots and, as a member of a shooting club, I knew immediately that they were firing,” the 65-year-old man told Bild newspaper. “It took several minutes for the first police officers to come up behind him. They then shot him at least 30 to 40 times. After that, I just heard them shouting: ‘He’s lying on the ground, he’s not moving.’” The suspect may have been influenced by religious extremism, the Bavarian attorney general’s office said on Tuesday, after launching an investigation into the shooting. “There are indications that the perpetrator was known in the Islamist environment. The investigation is ongoing, so nothing concrete can be said at this stage,” chief public prosecutor Florian Weinzierl, said on Thursday. Officials will investigate whether other people knew about the crime. The suspect was already known to police in February 2023, after making a dangerous threat against pupils and causing bodily harm, according to the Austrian police department in Salzburg. He was also accused of participating in a terrorist organization, and was active online. The teenager was also interested in explosives and weapons, the police department added. In April 2023, the Salzburg public prosecutor’s office dropped all charges, following an investigation. Authorities confirmed a weapons ban against the then 17-year-old, which was scheduled to remain in place until at least the beginning of 2028. He had not been reported to officers since then, the police department added. The incident took place on the anniversary of the 1972 Munich Olympics terror attack – when a Palestinian militant group entered the quarters of Israel’s national team. Eleven Israeli athletes were killed in the ensuing standoff. It is not clear if Thursday’s incident is at connected to the 1972 event, but the Israeli consulate nearby was closed for a commemoration. Bavarian Minister President Markus Soeder cautioned there is a “terrible suspicion” that the shooting was linked to the anniversary, but said more clarification was needed to determine the motive. “The protection of Jewish institutions is of central importance to us,” he said in a press conference on Tuesday. “The motives and backgrounds of the perpetrators will certainly have to be determined in the coming hours, but one thing is clear, there is a serious suspicion, because today is the anniversary of the attack in Munich in 1972, there may be a connection.” On Facebook, Talya Lador-Fresher, the Israeli consul general in Munich said, “We are very grateful to the police in Munich for their actions and cooperation. This event shows how dangerous the rise of Antisemitism is. It is important that the general public speaks against this. Our Consulate General was closed today to commemorate 52 years since the terrorist attack at the Olympics.” Chancellor Olaf Scholz condemned the terror attack on Thursday. “Let me be clear: anti-Semitism and Islamism have no place in our country,” he said in a post on X. “The quick reaction of the emergency services in Munich today may have prevented something terrible from happening. I am very grateful to them for that.” The incident came on the heels of a divisive round of regional elections in Germany – after the Alternative for Germany (AfD) became the first far-right party to win a state election in the country since the Nazi era, on Sunday.

Hydrogen-powered skyscraper set for Egypt’s new capital,"Tom Page,CNN","4:28 AM EDT, Wed September 4, 2024",4 minute,"Style,Architecture","Egypt’s “New Administrative Capital,” a new city deep into construction outside Cairo, has prompted plenty of blue-sky thinking. But few ideas have been as ambitious as powering a skyscraper with hydrogen. The Forbes International Tower, a 240 meter (787 feet) tall office building due to be constructed close to the Iconic Tower — Africa’s tallest building — was planned from the outset to be environmentally conscious. Designed by Gordon Gill of Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture, the firm behind Central Park Tower, New York, and the upcoming Jeddah Tower, Saudi Arabia, its developer Magnom Properties has now revealed it intends to achieve a net-zero carbon footprint by powering the 43-floor office building via clean hydrogen, supplemented by solar panels on its facade. Powered by 75% hydrogen and 25% photovoltaics, the building would not rely on a traditional power grid, according to Magnom, its developer. Magnom said constructing with materials with “low-embodied carbon” — materials with reduced associated emissions via their sourcing, manufacture and eventual disposal or reuse — could cut the carbon footprint of its construction by 58%. Meanwhile, water recycling and treatment on site will reduce freshwater demand — vital in an increasingly water-scarce country. Through these methods, Magnom says it aims to achieve a “net-negative carbon vision” (removing more carbon than it emits) for the skyscraper over its lifecycle, and to become the first skyscraper in the world to register for Zero Carbon Certificate from the International Living Future Institute. The buildingmarks the latest chapter in net-zero architecture, following the likes of Foster + Partner’s Z6 tower in Beijing, which has net-zero operational emissions, and the upcoming Curzon Wharf in Birmingham, England, featuring a 565 foot tower as part of a large, net-zero carbon mixed-use development. Using hydrogen to reduce a building’s emissions is a novel approach, however. A potentially clean and renewable energy source — though only when sourced and produced through certain methods — hydrogen is an abundant asset little-utilized at this scale in architecture or by private enterprise.

      Grand Stade Hassan II: Design revealed for one of the world’s largest stadiums ahead of 2030 World Cup In recent years hydrogen has received significant attention from governments including the Biden administration, with US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm calling it the “Swiss army knife of zero-carbon technologies” in 2023. However, critics have questioned how quickly production can be ramped up to meet the energy demand currently met by fossil fuels. Magnom Properties has signed an agreement with Schneider Electric and H2 Enterprises to explore using LOHC technology as the skyscraper’s power source. LOHC — liquid organic hydrogen carriers — are organic compounds that absorb or release hydrogen through chemical reactions, and can be used to store manufactured hydrogen and transport it in a stable form from source to end user. Liquid hydrogen compounds also mean existing fossil fuel transport infrastructure could be adapted for re-use with the new technology. Once transported, the hydrogen can be stripped from the LOHC and placed in a fuel cell to produce electricity. The agreement, per Magnom, will assess the “design, space requirements and economic viability” of using clean hydrogen for the Forbes International Tower, meaning it’s not certain that hydrogen will be the eventual power source. Other architects are also wrestling with alternative power sources and transmission to meet the energy needs of high-density environments. Another giant of architecture, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), recently announced a partnership with energy storage company Energy Vault to develop a gravity power storage system within a megatall skyscraper. The design — which could reach 3,000 feet high — would utilize an electric motor to raise giant blocks up through the building during periods of low energy demand; then during periods of high demand the blocks would be lowered, powering a motor and converting the stored energy back into electricity. SOM is also exploring integrating pumped storage hydropower into buildings, using water instead of blocks (an approach already taken by some dams). However it sources its power, the Forbes International Tower will rise in the heart of the New Administrative Capital’s central business district, where domestic and international companies are already moving in. The smart city, a satellite of Cairo touted for its sustainable credentials, began construction in 2016. Though ongoing, many key buildings have now been completed for the project, which has been estimated to cost around $58 billion."
Hologram boxes can beam ‘3D’ video into your living room,"Jacopo Prisco,CNN","4:59 AM EDT, Fri September 27, 2024",4 minute,"Business,Tech","Billing itself as the world’s “first holographic communications platform,” US startup Proto is beaming life-size, “3D” video into universities, hotels and medical centers. The company has developed a box — which weighs over 400 pounds and is taller than the average NBA player — that can show a video of a person, giving the illusion of three-dimensionality through some clever graphical smoke and mirrors. The boxes can reproduce pre-recorded video as well as a live feed, and any 4K camera, including an iPhone, can be used as the source. Although the images aren’t technically holograms, by adding shadows behind the body and reflections under the feet the box effectively tricks the brain into believing there could be someone inside it. “We just beamed William Shatner from Los Angeles to Orlando, Florida, to be at a convention that he couldn’t physically be at,” said David Nussbaum, the company’s founder and CEO, giving one example of how the technology can be used. Nussbaum, whose background is in radio and podcasting, started Proto in 2018. He says the company has 45 employees and has sold nearly 1,000 units. It has two full-size models — the Proto Epic and a newly launched, more economic redesign called the Proto Luma — which start at $29,000 and go up to $65,000. There is also the Proto M, a tabletop version that stands 30 inches tall and weighs just under 30 pounds, selling for $5,900. That’s an awful lot more than a standard Zoom call, although the company does offer a full-size model on a lease for $2,500 a month. Only one Proto is needed to set up a call, but Proto-to-Proto communication is currently not supported; while it is possible for two Proto users to chat, they still both need a second camera, such as a smartphone. Nussbaum describes Proto as “business to business company,” with clients including Amazon (AMZN), Verizon (VZ), Siemens, Accenture, Walmart (WMT), the NFL and major US TV networks. But he adds that he sees a future where a version of its smallest device is “in living rooms for under $1,000.” He said that by putting a 2D image in a life-size 3D space, Proto creates a more compelling experience than a standard video call. “You’re seeing me like I’m actually there. That means our conversation is more authentic. It’s more engaging,” he said. Proto boxes have been used at New York’s JFK airport and at the Beverly Wilshire hotel in Beverly Hills, California, offering a concierge service in suites and penthouses. A similar technology launched by Dutch company Holoconnects has been deployed at hotels in Scandinavia, and used for advertising by BMW. Google is collaborating with HP to commercialize its Project Starline, which promises to bring more depth and realism to video conferencing conversations, and Cisco is working on bringing “holograms” to Webex. Recently, Proto has started working with universities — including Central Florida, MIT, Vanderbilt, Stanford, and the University of Loughborough in the UK — beaming in guest lecturers from around the world. Gary Burnett, a professor of digital creativity at Loughborough University, who has experience with the Proto boxes, said: “In our initial mini-lecture tests, it was clear that students felt a strong sense of co-presence with the hologram speaker — believing them to be ‘in the room,’ sentient and behaving as an authentic lecturer.” “Most students were paying attention throughout the session and although this was not a formal part of their education, it was apparent that they were learning, as measured by a surprise quiz at the end of the lectures. Not surprisingly with such novel technology, we had some evidence of occasional distraction, usually in the form of students using their own phones to film the experience.” Earlier this year, Proto started a partnership with West Cancer Center, a clinic in a suburb of Memphis, Tennessee, allowing doctors there to be beam into clinics in remote areas. “For oncology and palliative care patients, non-verbal communication is critically important, because we are often conveying complex information and sometimes delivering difficult or challenging news,” said W. Clay Jackson, a physician at the clinic and a professor of family medicine and psychiatry at the University of Tennessee College of Medicine. “The patient experience with the Proto hologram is vastly superior to traditional, screen-based tele-health formats. The life-size, three-dimensional image truly immerses the patient in the visit, allowing them to give and receive communication as effectively as if I could reach out and touch them.” One of Dr. Jackson’s patients, Crystal Freeman, says the technology is a much more viable solution than standard virtual visits for rural patients. “I have (had) tele-health visits, which were ok, but service is sometimes spotty and you really didn’t have the feel like you were in an actual doctor visit,” she said. Nussbaum says he uses the technology at home to connect his children in Los Angeles with his parents in New Jersey — a scenario where he says even a video call doesn’t quite cut it. “Sure, you could communicate, but you can’t connect,” he said. “So I thought, what if I could beam them into each other’s house? Now we’re doing that. So for me, I’m seeing a little glimpse into the future by watching my parents and my kids have a relationship from 3,000 miles away. That, to me, is one of the greatest things that we’re doing.”"
Here are the eight new emoji coming to smartphones,"Jordan Valinsky,CNN","8:41 AM EDT, Mon September 23, 2024",2 minute,"Business,Tech","Finally, an emoji to represent us all is coming soon: An exhausted face with bags under its eyes. It’s one of eight new emojis that will appear on smartphones and computers next year, which also include a root vegetable, a harp, a leafless tree, a fingerprint, a shovel, a purple splatter, and a flag for the remote island in the English Channel called Sark. Emojipedia, a popular emoji reference site, released sample images a few months ago. Recently, the Unicode Consortium, the non-profit that oversees global emoji standards and new releases approved the new emoji lineup. Smartphone users can start using the new emojis across “various digital devices over the next few months and throughout 2025,” Emojipedia said. The exhausted emoji face had the honors of winning the “most anticipated” emoji in the World Emoji Awards receiving more than 60% of the vote. The splatter and shovel came in second place and third place, respectively. Although those might be goofy, the leafless tree is meant to raise awareness of drought and climate change, according to Brian Baihaki, who submitted it to the Unicode Consortium. “Drought is a natural part of climate cycle, for million of years trees have adapted to these harsh condition,” Baihaki wrote. “But the climate is changing, drought become more frequent, severe, and even spread to other places in short amount of time.” Different operating services, such as Apple iOS and Alphabet’s Android, and companies put their own spin on the emoji designs. The interpretations can lead to controversy, such as Google’s misplacement of foam somehow hovering above a half-full glass of beer, and the jumbling of ingredients (with cheese on the bottom) on its hamburger emoji. Both were corrected."
Social media platforms are using what you create for artificial intelligence. Here’s how to opt out,"Clare Duffy,CNN","5:00 AM EDT, Mon September 23, 2024",6 minute,"Business,Tech","OpenAI has claimed that creating ChatGPT would have been impossible without using copyrighted works. LinkedIn is using user resumes to polish up its artificial intelligence model. And Snapchat says if you use a certain AI feature, it might put your face in an ad. These days, people’s social media posts — not just what they write, even their images — are increasingly being used by companies for and with their AI systems, whether they realize it or not. For companies running AI models, social media platforms offer valuable data. What’s written there is conversational, something AI chatbots consistently strive to be. Social media posts include human slang that might be useful for the tools to use themselves. And news feeds are generally a source of real-time happenings. But users posting on those sites may not be so enthusiastic about their every random musing or vacationphoto or regrettable selfie being freely used to build technology (and, by extension, make money) for a multibillion-dollar corporation. “Right now, there is a lot of fear being created around AI, some of it well-founded and some based in science fiction, so it’s on these platforms to be very open about how they will and won’t use our data to help alleviate some of the reactions that this type of news brings — which for me, it doesn’t feel like that has been done yet,” David Ogiste, the founder of marketing agency Nobody’s Cafe who regularly posts about branding and creativity on LinkedIn, said in a message to CNN. He added that he would opt out of allowing LinkedIn use his data for AI training. Different social platforms vary in terms of the options they give users to opt-out of contributing to AI systems. But here’s the reality: If you’re posting content publicly online, there’s no way to absolutely be certain your images won’t be hoovered up by some third party for them to use in any way they like. At the very least, it’s worth being aware that this is happening. Here’s where some of the major social media platforms may be using your data to train and run AI models, and how (and if) you can opt out. LinkedIn this week began giving users the choice to opt-out of having their data used to train it generative AI models. The company says user content may be used by LinkedIn and its “affiliates,” potentially including Microsoft partner OpenAI. It says that it aims to “redact or remove personal data” from training datasets. To opt out, users should go to “Settings & Privacy,” select the “Data Privacy” tab in the lefthand column, and then click “Data for Generative AI Improvement” and toggle the button off. The platform notes, however, that, “opting out means that LinkedIn and its affiliates won’t use your personal data or content on LinkedIn to train models going forward, but does not affect training that has already taken place.” That means, there’s no going back and undoing the training of earlier LinkedIn AI systems with user posts. If you live in the United Kingdom, Switzerland or Europe — where privacy protections are more robust than other jurisdictions — you may not see the opt-out option, as LinkedIn says it does not train AI on user data from those areas. Elon Musk’s X also requires users to opt out if they don’t want their posts used to train its AI chatbot, Grok, which has come under fire for things like spreading false information about the 2024 election and generating violent, graphic fake images of prominent politicians. The platform says it and Musk’s xAI startup use people’s posts, as well as their conversations with Grok, to do things like improve its “ability to provide accurate, relevant, and engaging responses” and develop its “sense of humor and wit.” (X didn’t proactively notify users their data would be used this way; the policy update was identified by eagle-eyed users.) X users can opt out by going to “Settings,” then “Privacy and Safety.” Under the “Data Sharing and Personalization” header, there is a tab for “Grok,” where users can uncheck the box allowing the platform to use their data for AI training. X also says that users who make their accounts private will not have their posts used to “train Grok’s underlying model or to generate responses to user queries.” Snapchat’s “My Selfie” feature lets users and their friends turn their selfies into AI-generated images. Those selfies can also be used by Snap (as well as brands that advertise on the platform) to create AI-generated advertisements featuring users’ faces if they use the feature, tech news site 404 Media first reported this week. In its terms of service, Snapchat says users’ selfies shared via the feature will be used “to develop and improve machine learning models … and for research purposes.” It also says that by using the feature, users agree that they may see themselves depicted in ads “that will be visible only to you” without compensation. But users also agree to allow much broader access to those images, too. According to the terms of service, “By using My Selfie, you grant Snap, our affiliates, other users of the Services, and our business partners an unrestricted, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable and perpetual right and license to use, create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, reproduce, distribute, synchronize, overlay graphics on, overlay auditory effects on, publicly perform, and publicly display all or any portion of generated images of you and your likeness derived from your My Selfie, in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods, now known or later developed, for commercial and non-commercial purposes.” My Selfie is a feature that Snapchat users have to opt-in to create, so users won’t be defaulted into having all images they share with the platform used in this way. What’s more, users who have turned on My Selfie can go to “Settings,” then “My Account” and “My Selfie” and toggle off “See My Selfie in Ads” to avoid having their image used to create AI-generated sponsored content. Reddit says that all users who share content publicly on the site grant it a free, worldwide license “to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, distribute, store, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats.” That includes letting third parties have access to users’ posts for AI training. Reddit has inked major deals with Google and OpenAI to share platform data to train their AI models, as part of its effort to become profitable. Redditors can’t opt out of having their public posts used in this way, but the platform says private content, such as private messages, posts in private communities, and browsing history, won’t be shared with third parties. Meta leaders have acknowledged the company has already used public (but not private) posts from Facebook and Instagram to train its AI chatbot. In its privacy policy, Meta says it may train its AI systems with users’ public Facebook and Instagram content, including posts, comments, audio and profile pictures. So, if you want to opt out, you have to make your account private.Meta also says private messages between family and friends are not used to train its AI. Still, even if you don’t use any of Meta’s services, the company notes that it may use your information, such as a photo of you posted by a friend, to improve its technology."
AI-powered tech could help people with speech impairments to work remotely,"Nadia Leigh-Hewitson,CNN","4:26 AM EDT, Mon September 23, 2024",4 minute,"Business,Tech","You’ve probably experienced the frustration of being misheard or misunderstood by a smart speaker or AI assistant. For people with non-standard speech, it can happen in nearly every interaction with this kind of technology — Israeli company Voiceitt aims to change that. By using personalized voice models, its AI-powered speech recognition system helps people with speech impairments, caused by conditions like cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s, Down Syndrome or stroke, communicate more effectively with both people and digital devices. For Voiceitt co-founder Sara Smolley, facilitating speech recognition for non-standard speech patterns is a personal mission. “My grandmother was diagnosed with early-onset Parkinson’s disease,” she said. “By the time I was born, she had lost most of her motor capabilities, and her speech was impacted.” Voiceitt was launched as an app in 2021 and operated as a simple vocal translator, converting non-standard speech to audio. The AI is trained by the user recording themselves saying around 200 simple stock phrases. Smolley said the original idea was to facilitate in-person communication, but the technology has now also been tailored to remote workers. Voiceitt has developed integrations with WebEx and ChatGPT, along with a Google Chrome extension, which convert non-standard speech to captions shown on the screen. The company is also partnering with Zoom and Microsoft Teams. “One of the things that really stood out to me was the importance of accessibility technology in the workplace,” Smolley noted. “What a (wheelchair) ramp was to yesterday’s office building Voiceitt is to today’s remote workplace,” she said. The software is sold as either a per-minute or per-user license, with prices ranging from $20 to $50. Licenses can be bought in bulk for workplaces and health or education institutions. “People are using Voiceitt not just for video meetings, but for writing documents, emails, posting on LinkedIn and accessing web browsers by voice,” Smolley explained. “This has opened up the digital world for individuals who previously might not have been considered for certain jobs or able to communicate with colleagues or customers.” Among users of Voiceitt is Colin Hughes, a former BBC producer turned accessibility advocate. Living with muscular dystrophy, Hughes relies on dictation for his digital interactions, making him acutely aware of both the potential and limitations of current technologies. Hughes has used Voiceitt to compose emails and dictate longer written pieces. “I found Voiceitt’s app to be impressively accurate with my atypical speech, and its training and setup process was straightforward,” Hughes said, though he highlighted critical gaps for professional users. “Many people with impaired speech and upper-limb disabilities need more than just speech-to-text,” he noted. He advocates for features like voice-driven cursor control and improved dictation recognition for drafting long-form content, saying that Voiceitt works best for single-sentence messages. Hughes stresses a need for more comprehensive speech-recognition tech that lets users do things like manage emails and format documents using their voice. He sees a future where technology plays a bigger role in accessibility, adding: “This entire sector needs a shake-up. Voiceitt, with better access to major platforms, could be the one to lead this change.” According to Smolley, there has been significant progress in speech recognition technology in recent years. One example is the Speech Accessibility Project, a research project led by the University of Illinois’ Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, which is collecting voice data from people with different conditions to build algorithms for supporting people with non-standard speech. Earlier this year, Apple (AAPL) launched its AI-powered “Listen for Atypical Speech” feature, which uses machine learning to recognize a wider range of speech patterns. With technology that captures and stores personal data such as voice recordings, privacy can be a concern for users. Smolley says her company complies with European Union regulations, which she calls “the highest standards in the world in terms of data privacy.” “If the user’s data is being kept in our database with their consent, it’s anonymized and de-identified, and used to augment our data stack and improve our algorithm,” she adds. She believes Voiceitt’s technology can be life-changing. “We want to allow people not just to be more independent in their lives and work,” says Smolley, “but also to enjoy technology and have fun.”"
Grit and glamour: Behind-the-scenes docuseries asks what it takes to become a K-pop idol,"Lex Harvey,CNN","10:01 PM EDT, Thu August 29, 2024",5 minute,"Style,Arts","A new docuseries gives viewers an intimate look at the lives and struggles of K-pop stars, exploring the true cost of making it in South Korea’s cut-throat music industry. Apple TV+’s “K-Pop Idols” follows Jessi (Jessica Ho), a Korean American rapper forging a new path after leaving “Gangnam Style” artist Psy’s record label; girl group Blackswan, on the quest for global stardom but set back by interpersonal conflicts; and rookie Cravity, a nine-member boy band trying to make a name for itself after debuting during the Covid-19 pandemic. While Jessi has been on the Korean music scene since releasing her debut single in 2005, Cravity is a splashy newcomer trying to carve out its own style and space in a crowded market. Blackswan has existed for more than a decade with different members and names, but is trying to find its way in its current iteration, which evolves as the show develops. South Korean cultural exports have exploded over the past decade, with super-groups like BTS and Blackpink topping international music charts and K-drama series achieving mass popularity on streaming platforms. Following the performers as they embark on world tours, share emotional moments and undergo grueling hours-long training sessions, the new show offers insight into the highly competitive, multibillion dollar industry that holds its young stars to extremely high standards. K-pop idols, many of whom begin training as young teens, are often subjected to intense pressure from their strict management, a work culture that has been linked to a mental health crisis in the industry. Several K-pop stars have taken their own lives in recent years, prompting outpourings of grief from fans. One of the major storylines centers on the conflict between Blackswan members Leia (Larissa Ayumi Cartes Sakata) and Fatou (Fatou Samba), which begins when Leia posts on social media that she is bored during a social gathering at Fatou’s family home after the group’s first concert in Brussels. Leia later says she found the gathering hard because she missed her own family back home in Brazil, a struggle she discusses at length throughout the series. She also addresses her depression, and the stigma that comes with speaking openly about mental health. Related article
      ‘The only thing we can’t do is sign autographs’: The rise of virtual K-pop bands “I know I am sick,” the Brazilian singer said. “Here in Korea, depression is not a sickness.” In another vulnerable moment, an emotional Jessi speaks about the sacrifices that come with the job, particularly in terms of prioritizing work over relationships. “When I go back home (to) Korea, I go back to an empty house,” Jessi tells viewers. “It’s so lonely. I thought this was a pretty dream, but it wasn’t.” The series also documents the K-pop industry’s recent efforts to increase the genre’s global appeal by recruiting foreign talent. In June, South Korea’s finance ministry announced that the country would soon launch a new visa scheme, called the “K-Culture Training Visa,” for foreigners who want to train in K-pop dancing, choreography and modeling. Having started as a Korean-only band, Blackswan’s ever-evolving lineup is today exclusively made up of overseas-born members. Gabi and Sriya beat thousands of young women to become Blackswan “trainees,” in large part due to their nationalities according to Philip YJ Yoon, director of DR Music, the company that manages the group. Gabi’s home country, Brazil, is one of K-pop’s biggest markets outside South Korea. And India, where Sriya is from, is the world’s most populous country — and somewhere K-pop is starting to make inroads. The women undergo six months of backbreaking training in Korean language, rap, dance, and much else, testing not only their physical capabilities, but their mental resilience as well. Labels also face challenges when recruiting foreign K-pop stars, according to Yoon Deung-ryeong, DR Music’s founder and CEO – one of them being the looser reins expected by band members.

      What it’s like to undergo 15 beauty treatments in just 3 days in South Korea “With other K-pop groups or girl groups, the company heavily controls the members. If the company says ‘don’t fight,’ they won’t fight,” he says in an early episode, referring to the conflict between Leia and Fatou. “But, with a multinational group, everyone’s language, culture and the way they express themselves is different. So, it doesn’t make sense to try to control them the way Korean groups are controlled.” Another topic in the show is the body image standards all K-pop idols must adhere to, and the extreme measures required to achieve it. The stars frequently speak about how little they eat and how much they train, even as their parents express concern. Gabi and Sriya are both placed on diets when they begin training – Gabi to lose weight, Sriya to gain it. Elsewhere, Cravity vocalist Wonjin says that when he first auditioned for his entertainment agency, Starship, he was instructed to lose weight, so he only ate one egg a day for two weeks, shedding 15 pounds. These tougher scenes are interspersed with moments of levity: the heartwarming friendship between Gabi and Sriya, a touching embrace between Fatou and her mother, the brotherhood between the Cravity members, the excitement of fans and the artists’ high-octane performances. Blackswan’s Fatou told CNN in an e-mail that filming the series was “freeing because we had an outlet for all of our bottled-up emotions.” “I felt like the camera was my therapist,” added Sriya.

      ‘Oldboy’ director Park Chan-wook on the new age of K-cinema Blackswan’s members said they hoped the series would humanize K-pop artists in viewers’ eyes. “We are not perfect, and we go through just as many hardships as anyone else,” said group member NVee, also by email. “But we still persevere because of our love for music.” “K-Pop Idols” is available on Apple TV+ from August 30.
