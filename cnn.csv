Israel launched strikes on Iran in a retaliatory attack. Here’s what we know,"Helen Regan,CNN","7:16 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",5 minute,"World,Middle East","Israel said on Saturday it had struck military targets inside Iran in response to earlier Iranian attacks, again raising fears that the long-running confrontation between the two powerful militaries could escalate into an all-out regional war that draws in the United States. The Israeli military said it had targeted Iranian missile manufacturing sites and aerial defense systems in what appeared to be a highly calculated response that avoided critical energy infrastructure, such as oil fields and nuclear facilities. Calling the strikes a “clear violation” of international law, Iran’s foreign ministry said in a statement that it “considers itself entitled and obligated to defend itself.” But Iran also appeared to downplay the impact, claiming its air defenses had successfully countered the strikes in three provinces – Tehran, Ilam and Khuzestan – and that the damage was “limited.” The Iranian army said Saturday morning that two soldiers were killed in the strikes, without clarifying where the deaths happened. The Iranian soldiers died “confronting the projectiles of the criminal Zionist entity,” a reference to Israel, the army said in a statement, which was published on state media. The US meanwhile described the attack as “an exercise in self-defense” that “specifically avoided populated areas and focused solely on military targets.” Israel had vowed Iran would pay for its large-scale missile attack on October 1 that saw around 200 missiles fired at Israel, forcing people across the country to take cover in bomb shelters. For weeks Israeli leaders have been deliberating on the nature and scope of such a response. Here’s what we know. In the early hours of Saturday local time, Israel launched direct airstrikes against Iran, conducting what it said was “precise strikes on military targets.” The Israeli military said its air force struck “missile manufacturing facilities” that it said were used to produce the missiles that Iran had fired at Israel over the last year. It also said the Israeli military struck “surface-to-air missile arrays and additional Iranian aerial capabilities, that were intended to restrict Israel’s aerial freedom of operation in Iran.” It is unclear if those manufacturing facilities also produced missiles launched by Iranian proxies Hezbollah, Hamas and Houthi rebels in Yemen. Iran later confirmed the attack but said the strikes caused only “limited damage” in some areas, while images broadcast on state media showed the calmness on the streets of the capital Tehran. Iran’s state news agency reported strikes targeting “military centers in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam” had been “successfully intercepted.” Several explosions were heard west of Tehran around 2:15 a.m. local time (7 p.m. ET Friday), according to the state news agency. Iranian officials said blasts heard around the country were related to air defense systems being deployed. The initial strikes were closely followed by a second wave, as video posted to social media by Tehran residents showed tracer fire and explosions illuminating the Iranian capital’s sky as dawn neared. A third and final wave then followed. By about 6 a.m. local time, the Israeli military said it has concluded its operation, saying the “mission was fulfilled” and Israeli jets “have safely returned home.” Saturday’s strikes are part of Israel’s long-awaited retaliation to Iran’s missile attack earlier this month, as the ongoing war in the Middle East continues to escalate to dangerous new levels. On October 1, Iran launched 200 projectiles towards Tel Aviv and Israeli military bases in what it said was a response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others, its largest ever such attack. That missile barrage came about 24 hours after Israel launched a ground war in Lebanon, opening a new front in its war against Iranian-backed militants. Israel and Iran have been fighting a shadow war through proxies and covert actions for decades. In April, that war came out into the open when Iran launched a wave of drones and missiles at Israel in an unprecedented attack in response to a suspected Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria.

      Iran engages in urgent diplomacy as it braces for Israel’s response to missile attacks In recent weeks, Israel has ramped up its attacks against Iran’s proxies, including launching strikes targeting the Houthis in Yemen, and militants in Syria. But it’s in Lebanon where Israel has refocused its operations after tit-for-tat strikes across the border escalated after Israel eliminated the leadership of Iran-backed Hezbollah in series of assassinations and airstrikes. Hezbollah leader Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli strike on his underground headquarters in Beirut in September. Netanyahu had previously said his killing was “a necessary step” toward changing “the balance of power in the region for years to come.” Israel’s war in Lebanon has since killed more than 2,500 people, displaced 1.2 million and created a unprecedented humanitarian crisis, according to Lebanon’s leader and international health officials. In a statement issued at the outset of Saturday’s actions, the Israeli military accused Iran and its regional proxies of relentlessly attacking Israel beginning with last year’s 7 October attack by Iran-allied Hamas, during which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and another 250 abducted. Following the October 7 attacks, Israel declared war on Hamas and launched military operations in Gaza that have killed more than 42,000 people. The UN’s human rights chief warned Friday that “one of the darkest moments” of the war is unfolding in the north of Gaza where the Israeli military is “subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and starvation.” A major concern of increasing military escalations is that Israel and Iran will become entangled in a full-scale war, one that risks drawing the US – Israel’s closest ally and biggest weapons supplier – into the fray. A senior US administration official said President Biden has “encouraged” Netanyahu last week to “design” a retaliatory attack that would “deter future attacks against Israel.” In recent weeks, the US and other allies have urged Netanyahu to exercise restraint and avoid striking Iran’s nuclear and oil assets. The US’ Gulf allies, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar, expressed similar concerns as an attack on Iranian oil facilities could create negative economic and environmental impacts for the entire region, an Arab diplomat told CNN. The White House said the US “was not a participant in this operation” and urged “Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation.” By refraining from attacking Iran’s oil or nuclear sites, Israel has potentially left room for de-escalation. But it is unclear whether Iran will respond to this latest attack. Israel’s top military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said after the conclusion of strikes that if Iran were to begin “a new round of escalation,” Israel will be “obligated to respond.” CNN’s Mostafa Salem, Eyad Kourdi, Alex Marquardt, Jeremy Diamond, Lauren Izso, Artemis Moshtaghian, Eugenia Yosef, Matthew Chance, Nechirvan Mando, Zeena Saifi, Alex Stambaugh, Samantha Waldenberg, Kayla Tausche, Paul P.

Georgia’s pro-Western president condemns ‘troubling incidents of violence’ at polling stations with crucial vote underway,"Christian Edwards,Niamh Kennedy,CNN","11:37 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",3 minute,"World,Europe","Georgia’s President Salome Zourabichvili has condemned “deeply troubling incidents of violence unfolding at various polling stations” as the country votes in a crucial parliamentary election. Voting opened early Saturday in the election, seen as a stark choice between Russia and the West. The ruling Georgian Dream party, which has in recent years taken a sharp authoritarian turn and stalled the country’s progress toward potential European Union membership, is bidding for re-election. Activist and monitoring groups shared footage that they said showed ballot stuffing at a polling station in Marneuli, southern Georgia. Another video showed a man, identified in local media as Azad Karimov – head of the opposition United National Movement (UNM) party’s regional organization – being assaulted by several men outside the polling station in Marneuli’s 69th precinct. Photos showed Karimov with a bloody nose and cuts to his face. Related article
      As Georgia votes, fears of a stolen election and a return to the Kremlin’s orbit loom large Voting has been suspended at that polling station and its results have declared invalid, the country’s Central Election Commission told CNN. In an emergency briefing, the head of the CEC called on Marneuli’s election officials to investigate the incident and take appropriate action. “This is troubling information, and the election administration, if confirmed, will not allow such isolated, controlled, or manipulative incidents to undermine the many months of efforts we have put forth into the election day,” Giorgi Kalandarishvili said. Zourabichvili, a pro-Western figure whose powers are largely ceremonial, said she had been unable to reach the minister of internal affairs and that “the official government lines are not working.” Before the election, Zourabichvili urged Georgians to vote against Georgian Dream. “In some cases, media equipment has been destroyed, and direct acts of violence have occurred. Groups have gathered with the sole purpose of provoking conflict and confrontation,” Zourabichvili said in a statement shared with CNN. “It reflects weakness, and I urge everyone not to be intimidated by it.” Responding to the reports from Marneuli, Georgian Dream politician Givi Mikanadze said “anyone who hinders the election process” will be punished, but appeared to blame the opposition for the incident. “The opposition has no tangible factor other than to stage provocations, because they know that they will lose the elections,” he said, according to Imedia Media, a Georgian outlet. After casting his ballot early Saturday, Georgia’s Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze told reporters that Georgian Dream will secure 60% of the vote and called on opposition parties to recognize these results. Government critics have questioned how Kobakhidze could know the results in advance. The CEC reported voter turnout at 50.6% at 5 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET), which Zourabichvili said was “very high.” At 10 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), the CEC will announce preliminary results based on 90% of votes counted."
Russian strike on Ukrainian hospital used to treat soldiers kills at least five,"Niamh Kennedy,Maria Kostenko,CNN","10:18 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",3 minute,"World,Europe","Russia struck a major Ukrainian hospital used to treat injured soldiers, killing at least five people, Ukrainian officials said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the Mechnikov Hospital in the south-central city of Dnipro one of the country’s “most important.” Before the war it treated up to 40,000 patients a year. Five people, including a child, were killed in the strikes overnight, said Serhii Lysak, head of the Dnipro regional military administration, posting on his official Telegram. The strike comes just days after Russian President Vladimir Putin faced calls from world leaders attending the BRICs summit in Kazan, Russia to end the war in Ukraine. Zelensky made a pointed reference to this week’s summit in his statement posted on social media, saying that “after everything said in Kazan, Russian murderers have resumed their usual business.” “This proves once again that aggression cannot be stopped by words alone but only by decisive action in defense of the state and the people against whom this war is waged,” the Ukrainian leader added.

      ‘What the f**k to do with them?’ Russian soldiers heard condemning North Korean recruits in intercepted audio At least 21 people were injured in the attack on Dnipro including a 17-year-old boy who is in a “serious condition,” according to Lysak. “As a result of the overnight missile attack, there is damage in several locations in the city,” Lysak said, adding that one apartment building had been destroyed and two dozen others damaged by the strike. Photos shared by Lysak showed rescuers working through huge piles of rubble and the inside of what looked to be a hospital room with blown out windows. The city’s mayor, Borys Filatov described a sleepless night he spent as missiles descended upon the city. “This is not just a two-story building;. This is an ordinary residential building with eight apartments hit with a ballistic missile,” Filatov added. Dnipro was not the only major Ukrainian city hit overnight. The capital, Kyiv also experienced a drone attack, according to the head of the military administration, Serhii Popko. A young girl was killed after her apartment building in the Solomianskyi district was struck, Popko said. A woman in her 50s was also killed by strikes in the Kyiv region, according to the regional military administration. More than 100 people were evacuated from the same residential building in the city after what Popko said was the sixteenth air attack on Kyiv this month alone. The Ukrainian Air Force said Russia used a combination of “various types of missiles, Shahed-type attack UAVs, and drones of unspecified type” to carry out attacks across the country. Ukrainian air defenses succeeded in shooting down 44 out of 91 Russian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the Air Force said on Telegram. Three Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles launched by Crimea were also detected, according to the air force."
Can New York Yankees recover from last-gasp World Series Game 1 loss against Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 2?,"Issy Ronald,CNN","9:45 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",4 minute,,"Just one game in and this World Series has already produced another classic installment in the long, storied rivalry between the New York Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers. It seemed impossible that this series could live up to the frenzied anticipation that had dominated the build-up or become another memorable chapter in the 83-year-old rivalry these two teams share in the World Series alone.

      Bridegrooms and Bums: How the Dodgers went from Brooklyn’s darling to Los Angeles’ colossus But, with one swing of the bat on Friday, Freddie Freeman ensured that Game 1 did so, hitting the first ever walk-off grand slam in a World Series with his Dodgers trailing 3-2 at the bottom of the 10th inning and down to their last out. He jogged around the bases as Dodger Stadium erupted in delirium, celebrating their team somehow stealing a 6-3 Game 1 win. Now, just a day later, the Yankees must regroup from their last-gasp loss for Game 2 on Saturday evening as they face the Dodgers on the LA team’s home turf once again. For the Dodgers, Game 2 marks a golden opportunity to stamp their authority on the series while they are filled with confidence before they travel to New York for the next two games at least. “To come out 1-0 is a huge start,” said Freeman after the game. The Dodgers are now three wins away from a World Series triumph and, historically, the teams who have won Game 1 have gone onto win the series 121 of 191 times (65%) of the time. Since 1995, that increases to 23 of 29 times (79%) and in the current 2-3-2 format, teams who have won Game 1 at home have gone on to take the series 68 of 101 times (67%). But the Yankees are still remaining positive ahead of Game 2. “We played that team really well for the whole entire game,” Yankees left fielder Alex Verdugo said after their loss, per MLB.com. “At the end of the day, we’re the two best teams out here, so we’re going to come here with our heads held up high, with confidence, and go out here and compete again.” Related article
      Los Angeles Dodgers’ Freddie Freeman launches himself into history with dramatic grand slam to win Game 1 of the World Series Both teams are stacked full of star talent and the Yankees can rely on the likes of Aaron Judge, Juan Soto and Giancarlo Stanton to pull off the impossible, like Freeman did for the Dodgers. The way in which the Yankees utilize their bullpen will be heavily scrutinized in Game 2 as well after manager Aaron Boone’s decision for Nestor Cortes to pitch in the bottom of the 10th inning. Cortes hadn’t pitched since September 18 after suffering a left elbow flexor strain, but was brought in to challenge the Dodgers’ left-handed pair of Ohtani and Freeman. “If I wasn’t ready enough and I wasn’t healthy enough, I would not have done it. And they wouldn’t have allowed me,” Cortes said after the game, per MLB.com. “So I think we’re in a good spot. I’ll get another opportunity. We’ve got to win four games in this Series. It was right there on our fingertips, but we’re going to come back tomorrow strong.” Carlos Rodón will start on the mound for the Yankees in Game 2, hoping to stifle the Dodgers’ offense, while Yoshinobu Yamamoto will be hoping to replicate his dominant pitching performance in June against the Yankees. Every one of the best-of-seven series games will be broadcast on Fox in the US, with each contest starting at 8:08 p.m. ET. The schedule is as follows: Game 2: Saturday, October 26 – New York Yankees at Los Angeles Dodgers from Dodger Stadium, 8:08 p.m. ET Game 3: Monday, October 28 – Los Angeles Dodgers at New York Yankees from Yankee Stadium, 8:08 p.m. ET Game 4: Tuesday, October 29 – Los Angeles Dodgers at New York Yankees from Yankee Stadium, 8:08 p.m. ET Game 5*: Wednesday, October 30 – Los Angeles Dodgers at New York Yankees from Yankee Stadium, 8:08 p.m. ET Game 6*: Friday, November 1 – New York Yankees at Los Angeles Dodgers from Dodger Stadium, 8:08 p.m. ET Game 7*: Saturday, November 2 – New York Yankees at Los Angeles Dodgers from Dodger Stadium, 8:08 p.m. ET *if necessary"

"The rape claims that tie the Menendez case to Menudo: ‘There might be other victims,’ doc producer says","Jason Kravarik,Elizabeth Wagmeister,CNN","5:30 PM EDT, Fri October 25, 2024",3 minute,,"Erik and Lyle Menendez have always maintained that they killed their parents because they were being sexually abused by their father. New evidence that may support the Menendez brothers’ allegations - some brought to light in a Peacock docuseries last year - could soon lead to the men leaving prison. The brothers have been serving life sentences for fatally shooting Jose and Kitty Menendez in the family’s California mansion in 1989. Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón announced this week that he is seeking resentencing, citing a letter allegedly written by Erik to his cousin before the murders in which he referenced being afraid of his father and sworn testimony from Roy Rosselló, a former member of the boy band Menudo, who claims he was raped by Jose – then the head of RCA Records – in the mid-’80s. Rosselló first publicly shared his account in “Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed” in 2023, which prompted calls to reexamine the Menendez brothers’ sentences in light of their abuse claims. “No other young man has ever come forward and said that he was raped by Jose Menendez,” Robert Rand,  a journalist who co-produced the docuseries, told CNN. “We believe that there might be other victims out there and we are hoping that they’ll contact us.” Rand’s project, a recent Netflix documentary and the series “Monsters: The Lyle and Eric Menendez Story,” all illustrate continued interest in the Menendez case and suggest an evolving societal understanding of sexual abuse, especially for male victims, Rand said. Rosselló recalled in “Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed” that he was 13 years old when he met Jose Menendez. “That’s the man here, that raped me. This guy, that’s the pedophile,” Rosselló said in docuseries as he pointed to a photo of Jose Menendez. He claims he was given wine and passed out before he later woke up in a New York City hotel room and found himself bleeding. “I was in terrible pain for a week. I could barely stand the pain. I couldn’t even move,” Rosselló said tearfully. The Menendez brothers’ habeas corpus petition, filed shortly after the docuseries released, cites Rosselló’s allegations. “Jurors never knew that Jose Menendez raped Rosselló a second time in a New York City hotel,” the filing states. “Some of the Menendez supporters were saying, ‘Well, where was Roy Rosselló 30 years ago when the brothers were on trial?” Rand told CNN. “But you have to understand that some people are so ashamed of being abuse survivors, they take that secret to their graves.” Rand and the series’ director, Esther Reyes, said Rosselló, who now lives in Brazil, would testify in Los Angeles, if required by the court. “He’s an incredibly credible witness,” Reyes told CNN. “I interviewed him for hours. He’s very consistent. He’s very clear.” CNN reached out to Rosselló regarding Gascón’s recommendation to resentence the Menendez brothers, but he was not available for comment. “Roy is well aware of what’s happening,” Rand said. “Roy is following all the new developments closely.” Rosselló would also like to speak to Erik and Lyle, according to Rand, who added that the brothers’ legal team does not want them to “meet or have any contact because Roy is a potential witness in a capital murder case.” “Roy has told us that he would very much like to meet the Menendez brothers,” Rand said."
"With worst-case scenario averted for now, White House and Harris campaign still face a serious risk in Middle East conflict","Kevin Liptak,CNN","2:39 PM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",6 minute,,"Ten days before the American presidential election, uncontrollable war in the Middle East appears to have been avoided for now, much to the relief of President Joe Biden’s aides at the White House and Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign team in Delaware. “It looks like they didn’t hit anything other than military targets. My hope is this is the end,” Biden said after receiving an update on Israel’s strikes on Iran early Saturday from his intelligence analysts. Such an outcome was hardly a foregone conclusion at the start of this month, when a massive Iranian ballistic missile barrage launched on Israel led to fears of major, escalatory reprisal — potentially targeting Iranian nuclear or oil sites. Still, if in Biden’s mind a worst-case scenario was prevented, the larger knot that is the Middle East conflict remains as firmly gnarled as ever. The direct attack inside Iran brings the region to a new, more dangerous place, with Tehran now mulling its own response to the response. Biden and Harris joined a call Saturday with their national security team and were briefed on the the latest developments in the region according to the White House. “We maintain the importance of supporting Israel’s right to defend itself,” Harris told reporters not long after that briefing, “and we are also very adamant that we must see de-escalation in the region going forward, and that will be our focus.” Asked her message to Iran, Harris said, “We as the United States feel very strongly that Iran must stop what it is doing in terms of this threat that it presents to the region, and we will always defend Israel against any attack by Iran, in that way.” Beyond Iran’s actions, however, the region remains at a boil. Israel continues to expand its operations in Lebanon, which have killed hundreds of women and children and tested American patience — but so far not leading to a major break. And the conflict in Gaza appears no closer to ending than it was before the death this month of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, whose demise Biden hoped would lead to renewed efforts toward a hostages-for-ceasefire deal. That window of opportunity remains cracked, at least in the mind of top Western diplomats, and negotiations will resume this week in Qatar. But few believe there will be any resolution before the November 5 US presidential election, leaving Biden and Harris’ inability to bring stability to the region a serious political liability. That is not where the US was hoping it would be in the immediate lead-up to Election Day, even if full-blown war between Iran and Israel isn’t currently breaking out. American officials don’t believe Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sees much incentive to end his multifront operations before the election. And there is little question in their minds Netanyahu sees former President Donald Trump — whom he has phoned up at multiple points in the weeks preceding Election Day — as a close ally. Campaigning in Michigan on Saturday, Trump brought a group of imams on stage after what he said was a private meeting backstage. “Muslim and Arab voters in Michigan across the country want a stop to endless wars and a return to peace in the Middle East like we had under President Donald J. Trump, have you ever heard of him?” Trump said. “They want strength in the Oval Office, law and order, and common sense.” Speaking Saturday before heading off on what has become a rare campaign trail appearance, Biden declared himself “not surprised” that Trump was in regular contact with Netanyahu. He acknowledged some concern that the Republican nominee was not representing the US in those conversations. For her part, Harris has offered little evidence she would adopt a different approach if elected. Questioned by a voter at CNN’s recent town hall in Pennsylvania about how she would “ensure not another Palestinian dies due to bombs being funded by US tax dollars,” Harris pointed, again, to the nascent ceasefire deal, without saying how she would succeed where Biden has failed. But pressed by CNN’s Anderson Cooper on what she would say to voters who won’t vote for her because of their fury over the administration’s handling of Gaza, she said — essentially — that Trump would just make things worse. “Listen, I am not going to deny the strong feelings that people have. I don’t know that anyone who has seen the images who would not have strong feelings about what has happened,” Harris said. “But I also do know that for many people who care about this issue, they also care about bringing down the price of groceries. They also care about our democracy and not having a president of the United States who admires dictators and is a fascist.” Those answers have done little to convince Arab American voters to throw their support behind Harris, who has given them little to indicate she would not simply act as an extension of the Biden administration on the issue. Abdullah Hammoud, the Democratic mayor of Dearborn, Michigan — a city with one of the highest concentrations of Arab Americans — declined this week to endorse any candidate, encouraging residents instead to “vote your moral conscience.” “I have not found any candidate, especially the candidate with the party I’ve affiliated myself with, who has been willing to depart from the current course that President Biden has taken us down on the genocide in Gaza and the broader conflict that has now touched Lebanon,” he told The Hill in an interview on Wednesday. A trip across the region this week by Secretary of State Antony Blinken yielded little discernible evidence either that Hamas was willing to update its demands for releasing the hostages or that Israel was newly interested in reaching a deal. While a main focus of his attention was planning for a post-war Gaza, the steps to reach that day remain as elusive as ever. For months, Biden has been trying without success to pressure Netanyahu into an agreement that would end the fighting in Gaza, which in his mind would lower temperatures across the region and potentially unlock a wider, transformative normalization across the Middle East. He’s been rebuffed at nearly every turn, leading to enormous frustration and long periods of silence between the two men. That pattern lent a degree of uncertainty to the past weeks, as Biden and his aides sought to discern how Israel would retaliate against Iran’s October 1 ballistic missiles attack. From the start, they signaled a different approach from April, when Israel’s successful interception of Iranian rockets and drones led Biden to encourage Netanyahu to “take the win” and forgo a response. The scale of the ballistic missile barrage made this time different, Biden’s aides said, necessitating action. But in a notably candid string of public comments, the president made clear he opposed strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, and recommended against going after the country’s oil reserves. In a phone call on October 9 — their first in nearly two months — Netanyahu provided reassurance those targets were not in Israel’s sights, despite pressure from some conservatives in his own government to seize a moment of Iranian weakness to go after them. It made for a rare instance over the past year of Biden’s advice being adopted by his Israeli counterpart, even if Netanyahu had his own reasons for avoiding the most sensitive Iranian targets and made clear his country’s decision-making was independent of Washington’s guidance. “It was extensive. It was targeted. It was precise. It was against military targets across Iran. It was in multiple ways, very carefully prepared. And again, I think it was designed to be effective,” a senior US administration official said late Friday. “As far as we’re concerned, that should close out the direct exchange between Israel and Iran,” the official went on. Whether that is what ultimately transpires, of course, is an outcome entirely out of Biden’s hands. This story has been updated with additional reporting. CNN’s Betsy Klein and Samantha Waldenberg contributed to this report."
The US wants this to be ‘the end’ of direct Israel-Iran fire. It may be too soon to tell,"alysis by Nadeen Ebrahim,CNN","1:00 PM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",4 minute,"World,Middle East","After Israel’s attack on Iran Saturday, US officials were quick to caution both countries against perpetuating the cycle of violence, but analysts say lasting de-escalation is not a foregone conclusion. The airstrikes “should be the end of this direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran,” a senior US administration official said after the attacks. After reports emerged of explosions heard in Tehran, Israel in a statement said it launched what it described as “precise strikes on military targets in Iran” early Saturday. The strikes were in response to Iran’s barrage of missiles fired at Israel on October 1, in retaliation to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others.

      Israel strikes Iran in high-stakes retaliation Iran said Israel “attacked parts of military centers” on Saturday in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam, causing “limited damage” in some areas. Iran appeared to have downplayed the Israeli strike, Iranian experts said. State media broadcast images showing calm on the streets of Tehran, with traffic moving and people going about their daily business. Iran’s foreign ministry condemned the attack, calling it “clear violation” of international law. The ministry added that Iran “considers itself entitled and obligated to defend itself” after the Israeli strikes. Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft in Washington, DC, said Iran’s downplayed response may be “more reflective of their desire to de-escalate than a true assessment of the damage Israel inflicted on Iran,” like Israel’s attempts to hide damage caused by Iran’s October 1 attack. Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense for Democracies, also based in DC, said Iran’s downplayed response may be “a strategic move to save face and keep US constraint on Israel.” After several hours of strikes Saturday, the Israeli military said it had targeted manufacturing sites used to produce missiles that Iran has fired at Israel over the past year. Israel also said it hit Iranian aerial defense systems early Saturday to allow its aircraft to attack the other targets. Israel’s decision to strike early Saturday morning came after weeks of deliberations within its security cabinet about the nature and scope of such an attack, Israeli officials said. American officials have been keen to show the extent to which Israel’s attack was restrained and precise, especially as the US pushed Israel not to attack Iran’s energy infrastructure, for fear of igniting a broader conflict, a request Israel seems to have heeded, according to preliminary reports. After Israel’s retaliatory strikes against Iran ended, National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said the White House urges “Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation.” But Israel has not always met the demands of its American ally. Throughout the war, Israel has defied the US’ calls for restraint – on the Rafah operation in southern Gaza, and more recently on a ground war in southern Lebanon. Disagreements between the two governments culminated in an October 13 letter from the US to Israel, demanding the Jewish state act to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza within the next 30 days or risk violating US laws governing foreign military assistance, suggesting US military aid could be in jeopardy. Danny Citrinowicz, a research fellow with the Iran Program at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv and a retired Israel Defense Intelligence officer who specialized in Iran, said it was too early to predict how the coming hours and days will unfold. “But one thing is clear,” he said, “Israel and Iran came closer than ever last night to the brink of direct war.” “The ball is now in the Iranian leadership’s court,” Citrinowicz said on X, adding that the Iranian regime likely faces a familiar dilemma: to strike back for reputational gains, or take Israel’s attack as an end to the direct conflict. Parsi of the Quincy Institute said that “if Iran chooses to exercise restraint… then this chapter may be closed, yet the conflict will remain very much alive.” When Iran chose restraint after Israel’s retaliation in April, it emboldened the Jewish state to take out key Hezbollah leaders in Beirut, which triggered the next cycle of aggression.

      October 25, 2024 Israel strikes Iran in high-stakes retaliation Experts say that while Israel presses on with its wars in Gaza and Lebanon, any pause in direct fighting between Iran and Israel is likely to be short-lived. As long as those regional wars persist, the overall trajectory of the Israel-Iran conflict will escalate. “While we may see some tactical de-escalation, the trajectory remains escalatory,” Parsi said, adding “a new exchange of fire between Israel and Iran will only be a question of time,” with the next round likely to be “more ferocious.” Israel has long tried to push Iran and other Iranian proxies back into deterrence.  But experts say Israel’s strategy may not be entirely effective. “Iran will not be deterred from escalating in the future if it so sees fit, neither would Israel,” H.A. Hellyer, scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies in London, told CNN’s Paula Newton, adding that deterrence is often used as an excuse by the attacking state, but only leads to more regional instability. “It doesn’t de-escalate through escalation,” he said, “which is the most incredible thing I’ve heard.” CNN’s Samantha Waldenberg, Artemis Moshtaghian, Alex Stambaugh, Eugenia Yosef, Jeremy Diamond, Chris Lau and Mostafa Salem contributed reporting."
Israel raids north Gaza hospital as UN warns ‘darkest moment’ is unfolding in the strip,"Abeer Salman,Eyad Kourdi,Kareem Khadder,Tim Lister,Ibrahim Dahman,Nadeen Ebrahim,CNN","12:36 PM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",5 minute,"World,Middle East","Israeli forces have breached a hospital compound in northern Gaza as the United Nations warned the war’s “darkest moment” was unfolding in the north of the Strip. After days of laying siege to the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, the Israeli military twice entered the hospital compound over the past 24 hours and opened fire at parts of the complex, the Gaza health ministry and the hospital director told CNN. The facility is running low on supplies and is in desperate need of aid as injured people from neighboring areas pour in following Israel’s renewed offensive in northern areas, according to health authorities. “One of the darkest moments of the Gaza conflict is unfolding in the north of the Strip,” the UN’s human rights chief Volker Turk said Friday. “The Israeli military is effectively subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and risk of starvation, as well as being forced to choose between mass displacement and being trapped in an active conflict zone,” he added, warning that Israel’s actions could amount to crimes against humanity. Gaza’s health ministry said Saturday that Israeli troops have detained all male medical staff at the hospital “while confining women in one of the hospital rooms without water or food.” World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that since the raid on Kamal Adwan hospital, WHO has “lost touch with the personnel there.” “This development is deeply disturbing given the number of patients being served and people sheltering there,” Ghebreyesus said on X. Prior to Friday’s raid, he said, WHO and its partners managed to reach Kamal Adwan “amid hostilities in the vicinity, and transferred 23 patients and 26 caregivers to Al-Shifa Hospital.” Ghebreyesus said later Saturday that Israel’s raid on the hospital was over, but came “at a heavy cost.” After 44 male staff members detained, the hospital’s female staff, the hospital director and one other male doctor were left to care for “nearly 200 patients in desperate need of medical attention,” said Ghebreyesus. Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, the hospital director, said in a video that Israeli tanks and bulldozers entered the hospital compound late Thursday and began firing at parts of the complex, adding that “all departments of the hospital are under direct shelling.” “Instead of receiving aid, we are receiving tanks,” he said. After an hours-long communications blackout and “intense bombardment,” Safiya told CNN late Friday that Israeli troops were still present in the hospital. “We all gathered in one place, and then the army called for me. When I went down, they put me inside a tank and began interrogating me about my statements and contact with the media,” Abu Safiya recounted. He said the Israeli military were “searching all the rooms, evacuating the displaced people and removing 44 staff members” as he spoke. “The situation is extremely tragic and terrifying, and the bombing is continuous,” Abu Safiya said. Kamal Adwan is one of three minimally operational hospitals in northern Gaza, and the closest to Israeli military activity in Beit Lahiya and the Jabalya Refugee Camp. Despite its limited capacity, it has been receiving most of the injured from the surrounding fighting. The Israeli military said in a statement Friday that its forces are operating in the area of the Kamal Adwan Hospital “based on intelligence information regarding the presence of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure,” adding that in the weeks preceding the operation, “the IDF facilitated the evacuation of patients from the area while maintaining emergency services.” COGAT, the Israeli agency that manages the flow of aid into the strip, said on Friday that with the help of UNICEF and WHO, several patients and their escorts were evacuated from the facility. The hospital was also given fuel, blood units and medical equipment. Maher Shamiya, an official with the Gaza health ministry, told CNN Friday that the Israeli military had demolished parts of the hospital’s wall. The oxygen station had also been damaged by Israeli fire, he said. Shamiya said that the military had entered the hospital yard for a second time on Friday morning and had begun separating men from women. “After that, it became impossible to communicate with anyone.” In his video message, Safiya said he was “shocked by the entry of bulldozers and tanks into the hospital compound,” adding that tanks began firing at the upper floors, shattering windows and “creating an atmosphere of panic, terror, and fear.” “Everyone in the hospital gathered in the stairwell; it was a very distressing scene,” he said. One video showed Abu Safiya speaking from within the Intensive Care Unit, where patients and medical staff were huddled. He said that some severely injured people were dying. Abu Safiya said that a number of properties around the hospital had been set on fire. Later Thursday night, a convoy of supplies from the World Health Organization reached the hospital, he said. Video showed a fuel tanker and other vehicles close to the facility. Abu Safiya said the convoy delivered enough fuel for five days, as well as 200 units of blood and a few other supplies, but no food or water. He said he had been in touch with Israeli officers. “I explained the situation of the patients and the injured people in the hospital, emphasizing that their condition was extremely critical and that evacuation was necessary.” The health ministry in Gaza told CNN Friday that 23 injured people had been evacuated in six ambulances. Abu Safiya said there were 70 critically injured people at the hospital needing evacuation. Abu Safiya also told CNN that there was a large number of injured people in the Jabalya area of northern Gaza, which has been subjected to intense Israeli military operations in recent days. “We have no medical assistance that can reach them, and I do not have the means to help them even if they were able to reach us. We have nothing to offer them.” It has been 21 days since Israel ramped up its military operation in northern Gaza. Authorities in Gaza say the military has stopped aid from reaching parts of the area and displaced many of its residents. Israel says it is preventing Hamas from regrouping.

Why these Republicans think voting against Trump could save the GOP,"John King,CNN","6:01 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",8 minute,,"Michael Pesce is conservative in the truest sense of the word. He speaks with an economy of words. He holds himself to a high standard but prefers not to judge others. He gets through tasks methodically, wasting no time or energy – even when enjoying his hobbies. Pesce is a hunter, and Pennsylvania deer season overlaps with election season. Archery hunting is open now, with a rifle hunting period set to open in November. So Pesce stopped by the ranges at a state park recently to check his gear. “Hunting season is starting,” Pesce said. “That’s more important than any election for a lot of people.” First, several shots at the archery targets, where Pesce at one point used a dime to adjust his bow sight. Once satisfied, it was down to the nearby firearm area. Pesce set his target 100 yards down range, and set his .30-6 hunting rifle on its stand. A few stalls down, two men were firing AR-15-style assault rifles. Dozens of shots, the empty shells piling up at their feet. Pesce quietly made note of how loud it was, then got about his business: just three shots to adjust his rifle scope, then two more to allow a visitor to test his aim and get a feel for the rifle. Then time to pack up, taking even the empty shells Pesce recycles for new bullets. A Coast Guard veteran. A Reagan Republican. A Nikki Haley voter in the April GOP primary who will be a Kamala Harris voter a week from Tuesday. Pesce’s conservative principles tell him he can never vote for Donald Trump. And they tell him he has to vote for Harris, to try to keep Trump out of the White House, even though Pesce doesn’t like surprises and does not believe the vice president has clearly laid out a governing vision. “That’s the scary part,” Pesce said. “I am not voting for a candidate. I’m not voting for a policy. I’m voting against a candidate and policies, and not even all the policies. Just, you know, the unstableness. Some of the things he says are truly scary.” Pesce is part of our All Over The Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are part of potentially decisive voting blocs. In Pesce’s case, he’s one of the Republicans in the counties that surround Philadelphia who supported Haley in the primary even though the former South Carolina governor had exited the race weeks before. They’re voters who view Trump as anything but conservative or principled. In many cases, they believe Trump must be defeated again to shake their party out of his spell. “If Trump loses, then I think Republicans will start coming back to what they were,” Pesce said. “Because they won’t have that radical right side. They won’t have the craziness and instability.” It was our third visit in five months, and Pesce, true to his conservatism, has been consistent: He said in May he would vote for President Joe Biden even as he raised concerns about his age and took issue with some of his agenda. In conversations since the switch to Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, Pesce has made clear he sees a duty to try to block Trump. He recently traveled West through several states that are reliably Republican. Turning on the TV or the radio was different. He returned to Pennsylvania even more mindful that he lives in the biggest of the presidential battleground prizes. “No one’s ever been through anything like this,” he said of the 2024 campaign. “Is this an election for Americans, or is this for those seven states?” It is important to remember our project is anecdotal reporting; the voters we are tracking, in this case Haley primary supporters, are not necessarily representative of the full universe of such voters. Yet they still provide us with valuable and sometimes telling insights. And they live in places that will be critical to the final math of who wins Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes. This time, we met Pesce at a state range in New Tripoli, which is in blue-collar Lehigh County. He lives a few miles away in Bucks County, which in recent elections has been the most competitive of the suburban collar counties that surround Philadelphia. Those collar counties represent one of the crucial 2024 math tests: Can Harris hold or build on Biden’s 2020 suburban strength or will Trump claw back at least to his 2016 performance, when he lost the Philadelphia suburbs but by a smaller margin than in 2020? In a state so competitive, tiny shifts can make the difference. Joan London and Berks County offer another glimpse at the battlegrounds within the battlegrounds. Berks is still red when you look at election maps, and it is too far out to be considered a Philadelphia suburb. But as the suburbs grow and change, often the exurbs do, too. Still farmland, but more given up to homes and services. Still plenty of Trump signs, but in some pockets surprising competition. “This neighborhood is becoming a lot like the Philadelphia suburbs,” said London, an attorney who was born closer to Philly, in Montgomery County. “This is a primarily Republican leaning borough, always has been. But when it comes to national elections, I do see more and more support for Democratic candidates.” A walk down London’s leafy street in Wyomissing proves her point. No Trump signs but Harris signs on several of the lawns on her block. Not her house. London’s lawn has one sign supporting a Republican legislative candidate. But London is voting for Harris – the first time she will vote Democrat for president. “Sometimes you have to say American first, conservative second and Republican third,” London said. Her decision is a shift from when we first met in May. Then, London told us she voted in the GOP primary for Haley but then switched her registration to independent because she opposes Trump and what she sees as his dangerous populism. But back then she said she would write in a conservative because she could not support Biden. She was even more firm in that belief just after Harris took over the ticket because she views the vice president as more liberal than Biden. She had settled on Pat Toomey, a conservative former senator from Pennsylvania, as her write-in choice. Then she watched the Trump-Harris debate, and it stirred why, back at the age of 18, she chose to be a Reagan Republican. “The last straw was what he said about the Ukraine,” London said. “When he said we have to have a negotiated settlement. … For someone who claims to be a conservative to say that was, in my opinion, outrageous. It’s appeasement. It’s dangerous.” She slept on what that debate answer stirred in her. And she awoke a Harris voter because, like Pesce, she believes the only way to get her party back is for Trump to be defeated. “I needed to vote against allowing him to become president again,” London said. She knows the polling in Pennsylvania and other swing states is tight and that Trump could well win. “I don’t want it on my conscience that I contributed in some way to that,” London said. London is reluctant to speak for others but believes she may have company among at least some fellow local conservatives. “I was surprised by how many people came up to me and kind of whispered, ‘I feel the same way as you do,’” she said. “So I have a feeling there are quite a few private conversations that are occurring behind the scenes in Republican and conservative circles.” It could matter if London has company. Hillary Clinton lost Berks County by 18,189 votes. Biden lost it, too, but by a slightly smaller margin: 16,841. That 1,348 vote difference seems tiny, maybe insignificant, when you note that Pennsylvania has more than 9 million registered voters. But ‘every vote counts’ is not a cliché in the battlegrounds: Trump’s winning margin here in 2016 was just 44,292; Biden’s in 2020 was 81,660. Cynthia Sabatini is another Haley voter who now factors into the battleground math. She lives in Media, in suburban Delaware County. Sabatini is a registered Republican but she has never voted for Trump. And she says she never will. “Trump is a non starter for me,” she said in a recent interview at home. But she is not sold on Harris, either, and her questions track what we hear from a lot of voters in our travels, even committed supporters of the vice president. “I don’t know who she is,” Sabatini said. “I really don’t. Because she had different positions than she does now. But she continues to say they are within her value system. So connect the dots for me.” What can Harris do to win her vote in these final days? “You need to answer questions on point,” Sabatini said. “You need to provide more details about your economic plan. You need to provide more details about your vision for this country.” Sabatini wrote in a Republican senator in 2016 when Trump won Pennsylvania. She voted for Biden in 2020. She is well aware of the 2024 math, and friends voting for Harris aren’t shy about reminding her how critical it is for the vice president to get big margins in the suburbs. “I don’t care what they personally think about that,” Sabatini said. “I don’t want to be forced into making a decision between one of the two.” She meditates frequently, sometimes twice a day, and says it can clear the mind for tough choices. As she ponders hers, she shares this: “I think Trump is going to win.” That, she said, is based on betting lines, not the polls. Sabatini does not want Trump back in the White House. She has a mail-in ballot and plans to drop it off on Election Day. Her decision could come as late as that morning. She will make it according to her beliefs: Either Harris will win her over or she will cast another write in, with Haley her leading choice if it comes to that. “The lion’s share of my friends are Democrats,” she said. “They think at the 11th hour people will have such reservations about Trump that it will cause them to vote for Harris. I don’t see it that way.”"
"In Texas, Harris embraces Beyoncé and warns swing-state voters that ‘Trump abortion bans’ are coming for them","Gregory Krieg,Priscilla Alvarez,Kaanita Iyer,CNN","1:19 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",4 minute,,"Vice President Kamala Harris, after being endorsed and embraced onstage in Houston by music superstar Beyoncé, warned voters across the country Friday night that Texas-style abortion bans would end up in their states if Donald Trump returns to the White House. Harris has leaned hard into her abortion rights message in the final days of the campaign, amplifying the stories of women affected by the state-level restrictions that followed the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade. Texas was chosen as the location for the rally, campaign officials said earlier, because of its harsh abortion ban. “Know this,” Harris said, addressing a national audience. “If you think you are protected from Trump abortion bans because you live in Michigan or Pennsylvania or Nevada or New York or California, or any state where voters or legislators have protected reproductive freedom, please know: No one is protected if there is a Trump national abortion ban.” Texas has some of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country, banning the procedure at six weeks – before many women know they are pregnant – with exceptions only in the case of life endangerment for the mother. A “trigger law” passed in 2021 took effect after the gutting of federal abortion rights in June 2022. Before Harris, Beyoncé or Rep. Colin Allred, the Democrat running for Senate in Texas, took the stage, the campaign offered the microphone to women who shared stories about potentially deadly health emergencies caused by new anti-abortion state laws that prevent doctors from acting swiftly when a pregnant woman’s health is in danger.

      Supreme Court won’t let Biden administration force Texas hospitals to provide emergency abortion care Amanda and Josh Zurawski, the Texas couple who led a lawsuit against the state after Amanda suffered life-threatening pregnancy complications because she was refused care, were among those telling their story. Shanette Williams – the mother of Amber Nicole Thurman, who died in 2022 from a treatable infection following delays in treatment stemming from Georgia’s abortion ban – was also in attendance. Harris in her remarks pointed to Josh Zurawski as she sought to grab the attention of male voters. “Men across America do not want to see their daughters and wives and sisters and mothers put at risk because their rights have been taken,” Harris said. “I see the men here. And I thank you. The men of America do not want this.” Beyoncé, whose song “Freedom” is played at Harris rallies, made a rare appearance at the event. After being introduced by her mother, the Houston native – joined onstage by former Destiny’s Child bandmate Kelly Rowland – said the country was on the “brink of history.” “I’m not here as a celebrity. I’m not here as a politician,” said the singer, who did not perform Friday. “I’m here as a mother.” Texas music legend Willie Nelson also attended Friday’s rally and played two songs for the crowd, asking them, “Are we ready to say, ‘Madam President’?” Earlier in the day, Trump took aim at his Democratic rival, saying at an event in the Texas capital of Austin that she was in the state “to rub shoulders with woke celebrities.” Before Harris took over the top of the Democratic ticket following President Joe Biden’s decision to stand down, she was the administration’s go-to voice on abortion rights. Her campaign released a new ad before the rally, called “He Did It,” that drew a straight line from Trump’s presidency – and his choices to sit on the Supreme Court – to the court’s decision striking down Roe, which opened the floodgates for statewide abortion bans. The campaign bought local television ad time in Texas for the first time to coincide with Harris’ visit. On the campaign trail, Harris has often labeled extreme measures on abortion rights being adopted across the country as a “health care crisis,” and she has argued that Trump is “the architect of this crisis.” Harris also connected Texas’ current effort to block a new administration rule meant to shield the health information of women who travel out of state in search of safe, legal abortions, to Trump’s ongoing refusal to share his own records. “On the one hand, Donald Trump won’t let anybody see his medical records. I gave up mine. And on the other hand, they want to get their hands on your medical records,” Harris said. “Simply put, they are out of their minds.” While in Houston, Harris also sat down for an interview with popular podcaster Brené Brown, the latest stop on her new media tour.

Georgia’s ties with the West face an uncertain future as all sides claim election victory,Reuters,"2:56 PM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",3 minute,"World,Europe","Georgia’s most powerful man claimed victory in an election on Saturday but the opposition called on the ruling party to admit defeat, setting the stage for a confrontation over the future of the South Caucasus country. Georgian Dream’s billionaire founder Bidzina Ivanishvili, the opposition, and foreign diplomats had cast the election as a watershed moment that would decide if Georgia moves closer to the West or leans back towards Russia amid the war in Ukraine. Early official results with 70% of precincts counted, showed the ruling party had won 53% of the vote, the electoral commission said, but the deeply divided pro-Western opposition parties said that they had collectively clinched a majority.

      Georgia’s pro-Western president condemns ‘troubling incidents of violence’ at polling stations with crucial vote underway Rival exit polls gave sharply different projections for the election. The Georgian Dream-supporting Imedi TV channel showed the ruling party winning 56%. Exit polls by the pro-opposition channels showed major gains for the opposition parties. Ivanishvili, the ruling party’s reclusive billionaire founder and onetime prime minister, claimed victory and praised the Georgian people. But the opposition also celebrated victory and said Ivanishvili should concede. Tina Bokuchava, leader of the United National Movement party of former President Mikheil Saakashvili, told Reuters that the opposition had won by a good margin of 10%. “Against that backdrop most people will be taking Bidzina Ivanishvili’s claims of a government majority with a large bucket of salt,” Bokuchava said. “We believe the Georgian public has voted clearly for a future at the heart of Europe and no amount of posturing will change that.” Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili – a one-time ally of the ruling party turned fierce critic whose powers are mostly ceremonial - and independent domestic election monitors had alleged Georgian Dream was engaged in widespread vote-buying and other forms of electoral abuse in the lead-up to the vote. Georgian Dream did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s, came to power in 2012 advocating pro-Western views, alongside a pragmatic policy towards Russia. He has since soured on the West, accusing a “Global War Party” of seeking to drag Georgia into war with Russia, even as he insists Georgia is on course to join the EU. Some Georgians told Reuters that they wanted change. “I voted for freedom and for the European choice,” said voter Irakli Andronikashvili in Tbilisi on Saturday, adding that he wanted a government which was “more progressive, less corrupt and more common-sense.” Georgia was once one of the most pro-Western states to emerge from the chaotic aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse. The road leading from Tbilisi’s airport is named after former US President George W. Bush. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Tbilisi’s relations with the West have taken a sharp downward turn. Unlike many Western allies, Georgia declined to impose sanctions on Moscow, while Georgian Dream’s rhetoric has become increasingly pro-Russian. Georgian Dream has drawn the ire of its Western allies for what they cast as its increasingly authoritarian bent. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban congratulated Georgian Dream for an “overwhelming victory.” The pro-opposition Formula exit poll said that the ruling party would be the single largest party but that the four main opposition parties combined would have 83 seats. Georgia’s four main opposition blocs are deeply divided, and it is unclear if they will be able to work together if they deprive Georgian Dream of its majority. Sandro Dvalishvili, a 23-year-old Georgian Dream activist, told Reuters last week that Georgia would face “danger” if his party of choice was defeated at the polls. “If it turns out that we don’t win, for me that’ll be very bad. Because I don’t see another force that will bring peace and stability to our country,” he said."

"SpaceX Crew-8 astronaut hospitalized but in ‘stable condition’ after splashdown, NASA says","Jackie Wattles,CNN","2:04 PM EDT, Fri October 25, 2024",3 minute,"Science,Space","Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Three NASA astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut were unexpectedly transferred to a medical facility in Florida rather than returning to their home base in Houston after their splashdown early Friday morning aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. One of those astronauts remained in the hospital Friday afternoon with a “medical issue,” while the three others flew to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston after a health evaluation at Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola, a hospital near the crew’s splashdown site in the Gulf of Mexico. NASA did not provide any further details about the crew member who remained at the medical facility. “To protect the crew member’s medical privacy, specific details on the individual’s condition or identity will not be shared,” according to a Friday afternoon statement from NASA news chief Cheryl Warner. “The one astronaut who remains at Ascension is in stable condition under observation as a precautionary measure,” the statement said. The four-person crew, which spent nearly eight months aboard the International Space Station before landing in the Gulf of Mexico at 3:29 a.m. ET Friday, had a “safe splashdown and recovery,” NASA said Friday morning. However, all four astronauts “were taken to a local medical facility for additional evaluation,” according to an update from Warner shared at 8 a.m. ET. The measure was taken for the entire crew “out of an abundance of caution,” according to NASA. The four crewmates — including NASA astronauts Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps and Alexander Grebenkin of the Russian space agency Roscosmos — make up the staff of Crew-8, a routine mission to the International Space Station that Space X carried out on behalf of NASA. All four astronauts were seen smiling and waving as they exited their Crew Dragon capsule and boarded a recovery ship during a live stream of their splashdown overnight. Related article
      A SpaceX capsule just came back to Earth. Here’s why Boeing Starliner’s astronauts weren’t on it Officials at NASA also did not offer any indication of medical issues during a 5 a.m. ET news briefing. “Right now the crew is doing great. They are going to spend a little bit of time on the recovery vessel going through their medical checks,” said Richard Jones, NASA’s deputy manager of the Commercial Crew Program, at the time. “They’ll soon be on their way back to Houston after all of those are done.” Extensive medical checkouts are routine after long-duration missions to space. And Crew-8’s stay was a bit longer than most astronauts traveling to the space station. Routinely trips typically last roughly five to seven months. “(Crew-8 was) the longest duration in space for a US crewed vehicle at 235 days,” Jones said. The Crew-8 team, which launched into space on March 4, faced repeated delays in their return home for a variety of reasons. Among the roadblocks were schedule changes related to issues with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, which had carried two NASA astronauts to the space station on a test flight in June but was deemed too risky to return its crew back to Earth. NASA ultimately chose to return the Boeing spacecraft home empty and moved Starliner’s astronauts onto the SpaceX Crew-9 mission, delaying that mission’s launch and thus Crew-8’s return. Additional weather delays also pushed the Crew-8 astronauts’ return into late October."
She was the oldest living American. This was her secret to reaching 115,"Dawn Sawyer,CNN","12:30 PM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",4 minute,,"Known as “Queen Elizabeth of Houston,” Elizabeth Francis died this week at age 115, making her the oldest person in the United States and the third oldest person in the world. Francis was one of the few people classified as a supercentenarian, a person who lives to be older than 110. The walls of Francis’ room are lined with plaques, proclamations and framed birthday cards from former President Barack Obama, the Clinton family and more who celebrated her long life each year. Politicians, community members and loved ones frequently visited Francis at her home in Houston, said her granddaughter and primary caregiver, Ethel Harrison. “She loved it,” Harrison told CNN. “She loved people.” Before her death, Francis was the 21st oldest American in history, and the 54th oldest person to ever live, according to LongeviQuest, a global database that tracks the world’s oldest individuals. Francis and her sister, Bertha Johnson, made history as the sibling pair with the oldest combined age in the world – Johnson reached 106 before her death in 2011. When asked earlier this year how she felt being the oldest living American, Francis told CNN affiliate KTRK, “I just feel like living every day!” Born in 1909 in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, Francis saw a lot in her lifetime. She witnessed 20 presidents, two world wars, a segrega﻿ted society and the civil rights movement, all in real time. On her 115th birthday this year, Francis received a letter from Barack and Michelle Obama, who acknowledged her contributions and the history she lived through. “Over the course of one century, you have made extraordinary memories and woven your own unique story into the American narrative,” the letter said. “You are part of a generation who summoned the compassion and strength to guide our country through some of our greatest challenges and triumphs, and we trust you take tremendous pride in all you have contributed to our great nation.” Francis experienced loss early in her life when her mother died in 1920. She was then moved to Galveston, Texas, where she was raised by her aunt. Her other five siblings were split up to different homes. In 1928, Francis gave birth to Dorothy Williams, her only child, and raised her as a single mother. Her life was spent looking after others, working at her church and running a coffee shop at TV station KTRK for over 20 years. Houston was home for most of her life. “My grandmother was also a caregiver,” Harrison said. “She took care of her brothers, her sisters and her dad. That was part of her life.” In 1999, it became time for her loved ones to take care of her. Francis moved in with her daughter and granddaughter when she was 90. She was there for 25 years before quietly passing Tuesday night. Harrison remembers her grandmother as a lively and active woman, even in her old age. With three grandchildren, four great-grandchildren, and two great-great-grandchildren by the age of 112, Francis was an “excited participant” at all of the family activities she attended, Harrison said. Those who knew Francis commonly attributed her longevity to her lifelong abstinence from alcohol and smoking. When asked, Francis would always attribute it to God. “I just thank the good Lord for keeping me here,” she told LongeviQuest earlier this year. “He’s had no reason to take me.” Francis’s faith was everything to her, her granddaughter said. It was what kept her going throughout the hard times and framed the way she treated others. “She had a Bible with her at all times,” Harrison said. “She’ll tell you that that’s what … (helped) her to live as long as she lived.” Her favorite Bible verse was 1 John 4:8, “Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.” It was this lesson that she instilled in her grandchildren, Harrison said. “She was a person who loved people. She cared about people,” Harrison said. “But most of all, she loved the Lord. I think that would sum it up for her.” Francis’ daughter is now 96 years old, and she is taking the loss well, according to Harrison. They all are. “I’m just so grateful that God allowed us to have her as long as we did,” Harrison said. “You know, we can’t be selfish trying to keep her here.” The family plans on celebrating Francis’ life at the beginning of November at her home church, Good Hope Missionary Baptist Church, in Houston. Though Francis has outlived most of her friends, the service will be filled with all who loved her. “It’s not going to be sad,” Harrison said. “It’s going to be a happy celebration. A celebration of life.”"
Iceland embraced a shorter work week. Here’s how it turned out,"Olesya Dmitracova,CNN","6:19 AM EDT, Fri October 25, 2024",2 minute,,"Iceland’s economy is outperforming most European peers after the nationwide introduction of a shorter working week with no loss in pay, according to research released Friday. Between 2020 and 2022, 51% of workers in the country had accepted the offer of shorter working hours, including a four-day week, two think tanks found, saying the figure is likely to be even higher today. Last year, Iceland logged faster economic growth than most European countries and its unemployment rate is one of the lowest in Europe, noted the Autonomy Institute in the United Kingdom and Iceland’s Association for Sustainability and Democracy (Alda). “This study shows a real success story: shorter working hours have become widespread in Iceland… and the economy is strong across a number of indicators,” Gudmundur D. Haraldsson, a researcher at Alda, said in a statement. In two large trials between 2015 and 2019, public sector employees in Iceland worked 35-36 hours per week, with no reduction in pay. Many participants had previously worked 40 hours a week. The trials involved 2,500 people — more than 1% of Iceland’s working population at the time — and were aimed at maintaining or increasing productivity while improving work-life balance. Researchers found that productivity stayed the same or improved in most workplaces, while workers’ wellbeing increased “dramatically” on a range of measures, from perceived stress and burnout to health and work-life balance. Following the trials, Icelandic trade unions negotiated reductions in working hours for tens of thousands of their members across the country. In 2023, Iceland’s economy expanded by 5%, a growth rate second only to that of Malta among rich European economies, according to the International Monetary Fund’s latest World Economic Outlook, published earlier this week. That is much higher than the country’s average growth rate of almost 2% in the decade between 2006 and 2015. However, the IMF forecasts considerably slower growth in Iceland this year and next.

      The four-day work week is here to stay at UK companies that tried it “Growth is expected to decline … in 2024 on further softening domestic demand and decelerating growth in tourism spending,” the agency said of the tourism-dependent economy in an assessment in July. Iceland’s low unemployment rate is “a strong indicator of the economy’s vitality,” the Autonomy Institute and Alda also said. According to the IMF’s World Economic Outlook, that rate stood at 3.4% last year, just over half the average for advanced European economies. The agency expects it to tick up slightly to 3.8% this year and next. There have been a number of experiments with the four-day week around the world. This includes a successful trial in 2022 across 33 companies, with the majority based in the United States and Ireland."
Scientists say skeletal remains found in castle well belong to figure from 800-year-old saga,"Ashley Strickland,CNN","5:45 PM EDT, Fri October 25, 2024",7 minute,"Science,Unearthed,Archaeology","Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Researchers have connected the identity of skeletal remains found in a well at Norway’s Sverresborg castle to a passage in a centuries-old Norse text. The 800-year-old Sverris saga, which follows the story of the real-life King Sverre Sigurdsson, includes the tossing of the body of a dead man — later known as “Well-man” — down a well during a military raid in central Norway in 1197. It’s likely, according to the text, that raiders lobbed the body into the well to poison the main water source for locals, but little else is said about the man or who he was in the saga. Researchers initially uncovered the bones in the castle’s well in 1938, but they were only able to carry out a visual analysis at the time. Now, scientists have an array of analytical techniques at their disposal, including genetic sequencing and radiocarbon dating. A new study on the remains, published Friday in the Cell Press journal iScience, reveals unprecedented insights into Well-man’s appearance based on in-depth research on samples of his teeth. “This is the first time that a person described in these historical texts has actually been found,” said study coauthor Michael D. Martin, a professor in the department of natural history at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology’s University Museum in Trondheim, in a statement. “There are a lot of these medieval and ancient remains all around Europe, and they’re increasingly being studied using genomic methods.” The findings not only shed fresh light on what Well-man looked like but also who he was, with a surprising twist about how he ended up in a Norse saga. The Sverris saga is a window into the ambitious rise of King Sverre, who lived from 1152 to 1202 and reigned over Norway during the second half of the 12th century. The text includes revelations about Norway’s early history, describing periods of political instability and conflict — with wars caused by disputes over who would succeed to the throne after King Sigurd Munn, according to the study. Sverre threw his name into the mix when he claimed to be a son of Munn. Munn was killed by his brother in 1155, which sparked the succession scuffle. While many of the Norse sagas derive from oral traditions and older lost manuscripts, the Sverris story appears to have been written in tandem with the events described within it — by someone close to the king. The text is rich in detail, including full names, locations, battles and military strategy as well as Sverre’s speeches. Throughout the narrative, Sverre’s men are referred to as Birkebeiner, meaning ”birch legs,” reportedly due to their use of primitive birch bark as footwear and leg coverings. Meanwhile, Sverre’s opponents, organized by representatives of the Roman Catholic Church, were called the Baglers, derived from the Norse “bagall,” meaning ”bishop wand,” the study authors noted.

      ‘Vittrup Man’ violently died in a bog 5,200 years ago. Now, researchers know his story In 1197, as King Sverre spent the winter in Bergen along Norway’s western coast, the Baglers carried out a surprise attack hundreds of miles away against Sverresborg castle, which the monarch built in 1180 in what’s now the city of Trondheim. The Bagler army crept into the stronghold through a secret door as residents dined, burning everything inside, according to the study. Well-man appears in one line in the text: “They took a dead man and cast him into the well, and then filled it up with stones.” Some of his skeletal remains were uncovered beneath large stones during an excavation of the well in 1938. More of his bones turned up in new excavations in 2014 and 2016 along the southern side of the well, including parts of his left hand (the left arm was missing) and skull, which researchers found disconnected from the body. Research carried out along with the more recent excavations suggested that the bones belonged to a man 30 to 40 years old at the time of death. It’s been difficult for scientists to determine how much of the trauma recorded by his bones occurred after death, but a blunt force injury to the rear left part of the skull, as well as two sharp cuts in the skull, likely happened before he died, according to the study authors. For the latest study, Martin and his colleagues wanted to bring together historical, archaeological and genetic context for Well-man’s remains. An initial radiocarbon dating analysis helped the research team confirm that Well-man’s remains were about 900 years old, which aligns with the timeline in the Sverris saga. The team was hoping to sequence Well-man’s genome from his bones, given that they appeared to be in good condition, but surprisingly, the DNA was poorly preserved inside them, Martin said. Lead study author Dr. Martin Ellegaard at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology instead used samples of a tooth to sequence the genome, which enabled the team to discover that Well-man likely had a medium skin tone, blue eyes, and blond or light-brown hair.

      ‘Bone biographies’ reveal what life was like for everyday medieval people The researchers collaborated with Agnar Helgason to compare Well-man’s genome with the genomes of anonymous modern Norwegians stored in reference databases at Iceland’s deCODE Genetics, where Helgason is the head of anthropology. The results showed that Well-man was closely related to people in southern Norway. King Sverre’s defeated army came from parts of central Norway, while the raiding Baglers were from the south. “The biggest surprise for all of us was that the Well-man did not come from the local population, but rather that his ancestry traces back to a specific region in southern Norway. That suggests the sieging army threw one of their own dead into the well,” Martin said. While it’s impossible to know the true intent of the Baglers when they threw the body down the well, the Sverris saga says the raiders wanted to make the castle uninhabitable and undefendable for King Sverre and his people. Placing a corpse into the only nearby source of drinking water would cause pollution, which may have been amplified if Well-man had a disease. No pathogens were discovered when studying Well-man’s teeth, but that may have been due to the destructive techniques used in examining the tooth. To sequence Well-man’s genome, the researchers had to remove the tooth’s outer surface to avoid contamination potentially caused by anyone who previously handled it during excavation, and then ground half the tooth into powder, which means the sample can’t be used for future tests. But other teeth from the remains could be tested. “Though there are other teeth available from this individual we need to consider if new techniques in the future will provide additional information than what is available with today’s methods,” Ellegaard said. “Another consideration is the scientific value we obtain. In this case we only have one side of the story — the saga — which has a clear agenda, and so here we can justify our approach to corroborate the one-sided written words, as opposed to if there were several records or other means of data available.” Related article
      DNA from 3,600-year-old cheese sequenced by scientists Maja Krzewińska, a researcher at the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Stockholm, Sweden, found the study’s methodology to be well-executed but said she was most impressed that the remains could be linked to an event described in a historical source. Krzewińska was not involved in the study. “There is always uncertainty about such old descriptions, so finding a correctly dated male skeleton in this context already adds to the interpretation,” Krzewińska wrote in an email.“However, showing that his genetic origin may have been in southern rather than central Norway, as was originally expected, changes our perception of the circumstances surrounding the decision of the victors to deposit this particular human carcass in the well. It opens up new possibilities for interpretation (for why the body was dumped) and allows for a deeper understanding and novel insights into stories we thought were largely understood.” While Well-man’s exact identity may never be known, he’s now more than just the anonymous “dead man” from the saga, Martin said. “Archaeological science, ancient DNA and genetic analyses give us tools to separate fact from fiction, which eventually should give us a more objective and complete view of human history,” Martin said."
The Washington Post is in deep turmoil as Bezos remains silent on non-endorsement,"Hadas Gold,CNN","1:10 PM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",5 minute,"Business,Media","One day after The Washington Post announced it would not endorse a presidential candidate in this year’s election or in the future, its billionaire owner remains silent as the newspaper’s staff are in turmoil. Jeff Bezos has so far declined to comment on the situation, even as his own paper’s journalists reported that it was Bezos who ultimately spiked the planned endorsement. A source with knowledge told CNN on Friday that an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris had been drafted before it was squashed. In the last 24 hours, at least one editor has resigned, and high-profile Post staffers have publicly expressed their dismay as many in the paper’s Opinion section are furious over how the situation was handled. For many current and former staffers of the venerable newspaper, the timing of the announcement was highly suspect and has led them to believe Bezos’s business interests influenced the decision. Former Post executive editor Marty Baron, who led the paper under Bezos during the first Trump administration called the decision an act of “cowardice.” “To declare a moment of high principle, only 11 days before the election that is just highly suspect that is just not to be believed that this was a matter of principle at this point,” Baron told CNN’s Michael Smerconish on Saturday morning. Related video
      ‘An easy decision’: Why ex-Washington Post editor resigned after paper didn’t endorse a candidate Trump has threatened Bezos “continually,” Baron noted. But when Baron was in charge of the newspaper, Bezos “resisted that pressure” and he was “proud” and “grateful” for that leadership. “Bezos has other commercial interests, a big stake and Amazon, he has a space company called Blue Origin,” Baron said. “Trump has threatened to pursue his political enemies and he rewards his friends and he punishes his perceived political and think there’s no other explanation for what’s happening right now.” Baron said Post publisher Will Lewis’s defense of the non-endorsement was “laughable,” noting that the Post has endorsed in other races. “If their philosophy is readers can make up their own minds on the big issues that they face in this democracy, then don’t run any editorials,” Baron said. “But the fact is they only decided not to run an editorial in this one instance 11 days before the election.” In a statement to CNN on Saturday, Lewis pushed back on reports about Bezos’s role in the endorsement decision. “Reporting around the role of The Washington Post owner and the decision not to publish a presidential endorsement has been inaccurate,” Lewis said. “He was not sent, did not read and did not opine on any draft. As Publisher, I do not believe in presidential endorsements. We are an independent newspaper and should support our readers’ ability to make up their own minds.” Several current Post journalists told CNN they have no problem with the editorial board not endorsing in any situation, with some actively agreeing with the decision. But they all found the timing of the announcement extremely troubling. “Deciding that now, right before an election, puts us in a lose-lose position: cowards for caving, or whining over not endorsing Harris, which the Trump campaign is already trying to use to undermine us,” one Post journalist told CNN. Another told CNN that “people are angry and feel like senior managers are undermining the journalism.” Others expressed deep concern that a wave of readers reacting to the news have cancelled their subscriptions, something that will directly impact the newsroom’s ability to function. Robert Kagan, a Post columnist and opinion editor-at-large who had been with the paper for 25 years, publicly resigned on Friday as a direct result of the non-endorsement. “This is obviously an effort by Jeff Bezos to curry favor with Donald Trump in the anticipation of his possible victory,” Kagan told CNN’s Erin Burnett OutFront on Friday. “Trump has threatened to go after Bezos’ business. Bezos runs one of the largest companies in America. They have tremendously intricate relations with federal government. They depend on the federal government.” Related video
      ‘There’s a lot of anger’: CNN reporter describes the mood in the Washington Post newsroom On Friday, Trump met with executives from Blue Origin, the space exploration company owned by Bezos, hours after the Post announced its decision Friday. The company has a $3.4 billion contract with the federal government to build a new spacecraft to scuttle astronauts to and from the moon’s surface. Trump advisers and supporters have been crowing since both the Post and the Los Angeles Times’ billionaire owners stepped in to prevent their papers from endorsing Harris. A post on X by a Post reporter noting that Trump met with Blue Origin executives the same day the Post declined to endorse Harris was reposted by Trump spokesman Steven Cheung along with multiple “love” emojis. Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller also pounced on the non-endorsement, writing: “You know the Kamala campaign is sinking when even the Washington Post refuses to endorse.” Earlier in the week, the Trump campaign used the Los Angeles Times’ non-endorsement in a fundraising email, calling it a “humiliating blow” for Harris. Other staffers said the decision not to endorse will ultimately harm American democracy, even though Lewis claimed in his note to readers that the move should not be seen as a “tacit endorsement of one candidate, or as a condemnation of another.” In a joint statement, legendary Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame called the decision “surprising and disappointing,” noting the timing of the announcement “ignores the Washington Post’s own overwhelming reportorial evidence on the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy.” A group of 17 Post opinion columnists also published a statement Friday evening, criticizing their own newspaper’s decision not to endorse a candidate in the presidential election as a “terrible mistake.” “The Washington Post’s decision not to make an endorsement in the presidential campaign is a terrible mistake,” they wrote. “It represents an abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper that we love, and for which we have worked a combined 218 years.”"
"124 killed as Sudanese paramilitary group attacks village, doctors and activists say","Barbara Arvanitidis,Eyad Kourdi,CNN","11:54 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",2 minute,"World,Africa","At least 124 people were killed in attack by the Sudanese paramilitary group the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on a village south of Sudan’s capital Khartoum on Friday, activists and doctors say, which, if confirmed, marks one of the deadliest incidents in a civil war that shows no signs of abating. The RSF has been battling the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) for control of the country since April last year. Both forces have been accused of killing civilians. The incident follows the defection of the RSF commander in Al-Jazirah, the region where the massacre allegedly took place. Since then RSF attacks have escalated, reports say. A member of the Resistance Committees, a grassroots network formed by Sudanese residents, told CNN that over 200 other civilians were injured in the attack on Al-Sareeha village, with an additional 150 detained by the RSF. The true number of victims may be “significantly higher,” the activist said, citing difficulties in documentation due to communication barriers. The activist requested anonymity on safety grounds. “The RSF militia has confiscated all Starlink devices — the only means of communication available to civilians,” they said. The activist also noted that more than 30 villages in the eastern Al-Jazirah region have been abandoned as residents flee retaliatory militia attacks. The Sudan Doctors Network has also reported on mass killings in the same village, saying that RSF forces “committed a massacre against civilians in Al-Sareeha” resulting in 124 deaths, numerous injuries, and the displacement of hundreds in attacks on Friday. CNN cannot independently verify the incident, or the numbers reported, as media teams are not permitted in the area. CNN has reached out to the RSF for comment but has not received an immediate response. The UN says the fighting between the SAF and the RSF has triggered the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Tens of thousands have died and millions have been displaced. CNN reporting last year exposed an RSF-led campaign to enslave men and women, and other atrocities by the paramilitary group and its allied militias in Sudan’s western Darfur region – an area already scarred by what has been widely described as the 21st century’s first genocide."
NASA chief calls for investigation into report that Musk and Putin have spoken regularly,"Shania Shelton,CNN","7:03 PM EDT, Fri October 25, 2024",5 minute,,"NASA Administrator Bill Nelson on Friday called for an investigation into a Wall Street Journal report that SpaceX founder and Donald Trump ally Elon Musk and Russian President Vladimir Putin have been in “regular contact” since late 2022. The report, which said the SpaceX founder has discussed “personal topics, business and geopolitical tensions” with the Russian leader, raises national security concerns as SpaceX’s relationships with NASA and the US military may have granted Musk access to sensitive government information and US intelligence. “I don’t know that that story is true. I think it should be investigated,” Nelson told Semafor’s Burgess Everett. “If the story is true that there have been multiple conversations between Elon Musk and the president of Russia, then I think that would be concerning, particularly for NASA, for the Department of Defense, for some of the intelligence agencies.” Some US officials have raised counterintelligence concerns in the last year about Musk’s interactions with US adversaries like Russia, but the US intelligence community is wary of looking into those interactions because Musk is an American citizen, an official familiar with the matter told CNN. Several White House officials told the Journal they weren’t aware of the contact between Musk and Putin, and the paper said knowledge of the discussions “appears to be a closely held secret in government.” The discussions were confirmed to the Journal by several current and former US, European and Russian officials. In one instance, the newspaper cited a request from Putin to Musk not to activate his Starlink satellite internet service over Taiwan “as a favor to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.” Musk did not respond to the Journal’s requests for comment. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Friday that he had seen the reporting but the White House is “not in a position to corroborate” it and deferred questions to Musk. A Pentagon spokesman told the Journal that the Defense Department does not comment on “any individual’s security clearance, review or status, or about personnel security policy matters in the context of reports about any individual’s actions.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the newspaper that Musk and Putin have only had one telephone call in which they discussed “space as well as current and future technologies.” Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Musk’s support for Ukraine — exemplified by SpaceX’s provision of Starlink services — has diminished as his public statements about the conflict have become further aligned with those of Trump, who has said he would negotiate an end to the war quickly. The satellite internet terminals provided by Musk’s company have been a vital source of communication for Ukraine’s military, allowing it to fight and stay connected even as cellular and internet networks have been destroyed. Dmitri Alperovitch, a Russia and cybersecurity expert, told CNN’s Alex Marquardt Friday on “CNN News Central” that Musk’s Starlink is “essential to Ukraine in particular because they really could not prosecute this war without” its services. After Musk trumpeted his early support for Ukraine, SpaceX then abruptly asked the Pentagon to pay tens of millions of dollars per month to fund Starlink in Ukraine and take the burden off SpaceX. In response to that reporting, Musk then abruptly announced on Twitter that he had withdrawn the funding request. Around the same time, Musk used a poll on X to suggest a “Ukraine-Russia Peace” plan that included re-doing elections “under UN supervision” in the regions of the country recently annexed illegally by Russia. After Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky questioned Musk’s preference in the war, the tech entrepreneur responded that he “still very much support(s) Ukraine” but feared “massive escalation.” SpaceX had previously limited its Starlink signal to areas controlled by Ukrainian forces, hampering potential advances that would have relied on Starlink communications. SpaceX then enlarged it to the rest of the country, and earlier this year, Ukraine’s Defence Intelligence claimed it has confirmed the use of Starlink satellite communications by Russian forces in occupied areas. Russia appeared to be buying the terminals from third parties; SpaceX said it did not do business of any kind with the Russian government or its military and that its service would not work in Russia. The statement didn’t address whether it would work in occupied Ukraine. Ukraine’s claim followed revelations in a biography of Musk, written by Walter Isaacson, about the satellite system’s use in the war. According to an excerpt from the book, Musk did not grant a Ukrainian request to turn on his company’s Starlink satellite communications network near the Crimean coast last year to disrupt a Ukrainian sneak attack on the Russian naval fleet. Musk’s decision, which left Ukrainian officials begging him to turn the satellites back on, was driven by an acute fear that Russia would respond to a Ukrainian attack on Crimea with nuclear weapons, a fear driven home by Musk’s conversations with senior Russian officials, according to Isaacson. In October 2022, Musk denied a claim by American political scientist Ian Bremmer that he had spoken with Putin about the war and a proposed “peace plan” to end the conflict. Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla and owner of X, has emerged as a major financial figure in this year’s presidential election. He plowed nearly $44 million in October into a super PAC working to restore Trump to the White House — pushing the billionaire’s total donations to the group to nearly $119 million — and he appeared with Trump on the campaign trail earlier this month in Butler, Pennsylvania. Musk also held his own town halls last week in Pennsylvania, where he urged voters to support Trump and promoted several debunked conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. The two have publicly discussed a potential government role for Musk. In recent days, Musk also offered splashy, $1 million daily sweepstakes for swing-state voters that has drawn scrutiny from the US Justice Department. Despite a warning from the Justice Department that the payments might be illegal, Musk’s super PAC awarded two $1 million prizes to registered voters in Michigan and Wisconsin on Thursday.

‘What the f**k to do with them?’ Russian soldiers heard condemning North Korean recruits in intercepted audio,"Victoria Butenko,Maria Kostenko,Lauren Kent,CNN","1:50 PM EDT, Fri October 25, 2024",3 minute,"World,Europe","Russian soldiers have been heard raising concerns about how North Korean soldiers will be commanded and provided with ammunition and military kit, leaked intercepts obtained by the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine and released on Friday show. The Russian soldiers talk disdainfully about the incoming North Korean soldiers, codenamed the “K Battalion,” at one point referring to them as “the f**king Chinese.” In the same extract, a serviceman describes another who has been tasked to “meet people.” “And he’s like standing there with his eyes out, like… f**k,” the soldier says. “He came here and says what the f**k to do with them.” The audio was intercepted from encrypted Russian transmission channels on the night of October 23, according to Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence. Ukraine’s analysis of the intercepts revealed that North Korean troop movements were planned for the morning of October 24, in the area of Postoyalye Dvory field camp in Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukraine launched a surprise incursion earlier this year. The intercepts also reveal plans to have one interpreter and three senior officers for every 30 North Korean men, which the Russian soldiers are heard in the audio condemning. Related article
      As North Korea, Iran and China support Russia’s war, is a ‘new axis’ emerging? “The only thing I don’t understand is that there [should be] three senior officers for 30 people. Where do we get them? We’ll have to pull them out,” one Russian serviceman says. “I’m f***ing telling you, there are 77 battalion commanders coming in tomorrow, there are commanders, deputy commanders and so on,” a serviceman says in another extract. The intercepted audio follows a Thursday announcement from Ukraine’s military intelligence service that a group of North Korean soldiers have been spotted in Russia’s Kursk region, an area that borders Ukraine and has seen ongoing military operations. In a post on its official Telegram account, the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine said some North Korean troops, who had received training in Russia’s far east, have made their way to the western Russian region, where Ukraine has maintained a foothold since launching an incursion in August. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday that he received a report on the deployment of North Korean military personnel from Ukraine’s commander-in-chief. “According to intelligence, on October 27-28, Russia will deploy its first North Korean troops in combat zones. This is a clear step in Russia’s escalation that matters, unlike all the disinformation circulating in Kazan these days,” Zelensky said, criticizing the BRICS summit staged by Russian President Vladimir Putin this week in the southwestern Russian city of Kazan. The Kremlin had initially dismissed allegations of North Korean troop deployments, but on Thursday at the BRICS summit, Putin did not deny that Pyongyang had sent soldiers to the country. North Korea said on Friday that any troop deployment to Russia to aid the war in Ukraine would conform with international law, state media reported, without explicitly confirming such presence. North Korea had previously dismissed such reports. “The actual involvement of North Korea in combat should be met not with a blind eye and confused comments, but with tangible pressure on both Moscow and Pyongyang to comply with the UN Charter and to punish escalation,” Zelensky added.

An 11-year-old girl played dead before escaping after 5 family members were killed at their Washington state home,"Alisha Ebrahimji,CNN","7:29 PM EDT, Fri October 25, 2024",5 minute,,"An 11-year-old in Washington state fled home in the early morning hours to escape a shooting that left her bloodied and wounded, and killed her entire family. For days this week, authorities have been investigating the gruesome, fatal shootings of five people in Fall City, Washington. Now, the girl’s account, detailed in court documents, is giving a first glimpse into what unfolded. The 11-year-old recalled waking up Monday to the sound of gunshots. When she looked outside her bedroom door, she saw her father, Mark Humiston, with blood on his head and her 9-year-old brother with blood in his mouth – both laying on the floor of the hallway, according to court documents. When her 7-year-old sister walked out of their shared bedroom, the 11-year-old said she heard another gunshot, before seeing her younger sister fall to the floor, the documents say. She told investigators the shooter then came to her bedroom and fired his weapon once or twice, hitting her hand and neck. Related article
      What’s next for the Menendez brothers as DA recommends their resentencing decades after their parents’ killing Despite the pain she felt from the bullet’s impact, the 11-year-old told authorities she recognized the weapon. It was her father’s silver Glock handgun, court documents say. And she recognized the shooter, too. It was her 15-year-old brother, she said. The 11-year-old recalled seeing her brother approaching the bodies of her other family members to see if they were alive, and pretending to play dead herself when he stood next to her bed. Their mother, Sarah Huminston, and their 13-year-old brother had been shot and killed elsewhere in the house, authorities said. The girl told investigators she escaped through a “fire window” in her room after her brother left the room and she overheard him talking on the phone. She ran to a neighbor’s home, where they called 911 just after 5 a.m. to report the shooting and the 15-year-old as the shooter, court documents say. But it wasn’t the first call 911 received about the shooting that morning. Seven minutes prior, the 15-year-old had called for help himself, sounding out of breath and stating he was hiding in a bathroom, according to court documents. He told a 911 operator his 13-year-old brother had killed their family and committed suicide, court documents say. The 13-year-old had been caught looking at pornography the night before and he was about to get in a lot of trouble, the 15-year-old told the 911 operator as a possible motive for the shooting, according to court documents. The 15-year-old was detained when authorities arrived to the home. On Thursday, he was charged in juvenile court with five counts of aggravated murder and one count of attempted murder with a firearm enhancement, according to court documents. CNN is not naming the 15-year-old because he is a juvenile. Under Washington state law, a hearing is required and a judge’s approval is needed before the case can be moved into adult court. In a Friday hearing, prosecutors formally requested the teen’s case to be moved to adult court, a process that typically takes months before a final decision is made. If found guilty and his case remains in juvenile court, he could be held until age 25 with no further sanctions, according to the King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office. If he’s convicted and charged in an adult court, the teen could be sentenced to 25 years to life with a statutory presumption of release after 25 years. Related article
      Alex Murdaugh could get new murder trial after South Carolina Supreme Court agrees to hear jury tampering appeal “I would remind everyone that these are not proven facts, merely allegations, and the law presumes our client is innocent of these charges,” Amy Parker, an attorney representing the teen, told CNN. “We want the court to know that our client is a 15-year-old boy who enjoys mountain biking and fishing and has no criminal history.” Investigators believe the 15-year-old “systematically murdered” his parents, two brothers and one of his sisters; attempted to kill his 11-year-old sister, and “staged” the crime scene before first responders arrived, according to the court documents. The 11-year-old girl told a 911 operator her eldest brother had recently been in “a lot of trouble” for failing some tests at school, and later told investigators he was the only sibling who knew the combination to the lockbox where their father stored his firearm, court documents say. Since the shooting, the 11-year-old was taken to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle but she has since been released, a hospital spokeswoman told CNN. A local family member has stepped forward to care for the 11-year-old and the elder sibling, who remains in custody, King County Council member Sarah Perry told CNN. “At this time, I ask you to join me in holding all family members, the community members of Lake Alice and Fall City, and others impacted by this terrible situation, in your heart with prayers of peace and healing,” Perry said in a statement.

      A 14-year-old boy in California allegedly used ‘multiple weapons’ to kill parents, injure sister, police say This year, there have been at least 427 mass shootings in the United States, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one that injures or kills four or more people, not including the shooter. Gun violence is the leading cause of death among minors in the US, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over 1,100 children and teens died in mass shootings this year alone, according to the archive. Earlier this week, the court ordered the 15-year-old to have no contact with his surviving sister, according to Casey McNerthney with the King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office. Mark and Sarah Humiston were home schooling their children, and were very active in the community, neighbors told KING. CNN has reached out to Hargis Engineers, where Mark was employed. “We are blindsided and saddened by the tragic events that have led to the loss of a respected colleague, mentor, and friend, as well as the loss of immediate family members,” the company shared in a statement to KING about his passing. “Mark’s leadership and vision were integral within our firm, and he will be greatly missed. Our thoughts are with his surviving family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time.”"
Los Angeles Dodgers’ Freddie Freeman launches himself into history with dramatic grand slam to win Game 1 of the World Series,"Kevin Dotson,Ben Morse,CNN","10:57 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",4 minute,,"With one swing of the bat, Freddie Freeman ensured the most anticipated World Series in years would live up to the hype. With his Los Angeles Dodgers trailing 3-2 in the bottom of the 10th inning, down to their last out, Freeman took the first pitch he saw into the right field grandstand at Dodger Stadium and sent more than 50,000 fans into delirium as the Dodgers took Game 1 of the World Series by a score of 6-3. It was the first walk-off grand slam in World Series history. It was a moment that echoed one of the most famous swings in baseball history – Kirk Gibson’s walk-off home run to win Game 1 of the 1988 World Series at the same ballpark. The parallels were uncanny: Freeman, like Gibson, is hobbled by a leg injury that has nagged him throughout the playoffs and the ball landed in the exact same grandstand that Gibson’s home run landed 36 years ago. Freeman yelled “I like that” as teammates dumped cold water on him to celebrate the victory. “That’s stuff [when] you’re five years old in the backyard right there,” Freeman told the FOX broadcast. “That’s a dream come true, but that’s only one. We got three more.” Related article
      History and star power fuel possible once-in-a-lifetime 2024 World Series It was a magical October moment that capped off a tense affair that couldn’t be settled in nine innings. The Dodgers scored the game’s first run in the 5th, but Yankees slugger Giancarlo Stanton quieted the LA crowd with a massive two-run home run in the 6th inning to put New York ahead 2-1. The Southern California native stood and watched as the moonshot flew deep into the left field stands, a sight that has become familiar throughout Stanton’s stellar playoffs. The Dodgers tied the game in the 8th inning, sparked by a double and some heads-up base-running from superstar Shohei Ohtani, who advanced to third base on a Yankees error. Dodgers right fielder Mookie Betts plated Ohtani with a sacrifice fly. In the top of the 9th inning, Yankees Gleyber Torres hit what appeared to be a go-ahead homer, but the umpires quickly determined that a fan reached over the wall to catch the ball. Torres was sent to second base with a ground rule double, where he would be stranded when Aaron Judge popped out to end the inning. The game moved to extra innings, where Yankees third baseman Jazz Chisholm reached on a single, then stole second and third base before scoring on a fielder’s choice to take the lead in the top of the 10th inning. But the dramatics at Chavez Ravine were just getting started. In the bottom of the 10th inning, Freeman stepped to the plate two outs and the bases loaded. Still nursing a sprained right ankle, Freeman turned on the first pitch offered by Yankees left-hander Nestor Cortes and crushed a towering grand slam into the Los Angeles night to deliver a stunning win for the home team. Friday’s display held extra weight for Freeman after his three-year-old son Max was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome – a rare neurological disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks nerve cells – earlier this year. In July, Max went into full paralysis and Freeman left the Dodgers team to be with his family at the hospital. Eventually, doctors said that his son would make a recovery and Freeman rejoined the team in August. Freeman celebrated the emotional moment on Friday with his dad who was sat in the front of the crowd, and afterwards, the 35-year-old paid tribute to the impact his dad has had on his career. “He’s been throwing me batting practice since I can remember,” the Dodgers star said afterwards. “That’s mostly his moment. … That’s Fred Freeman’s moment right there.” Freeman also spoke about the significance of writing his name into the history books through his Game 1 heroics. “When you get told you do something like that in this game that’s been around a very long time – I love the history of this game, to be a part of it, it’s special,” Freeman said. “I’ve been playing this game a long time, and to come up in those moments, you dream about those moments. Even when you’re 35 and been in the league for 15 years, you want to be a part of those.” The 120th World Series offers one of the most scintillating matchups in recent memory. With a combined 63 appearances, the Yankees and Dodgers are the most frequent visitors to the Fall Classic. The Yankees, however, stand head and shoulders above Dodgers and the rest of baseball with 41 appearances and an astounding 27 championships. These two storied franchises have met in the World Series an astounding 11 times, most recently in 1981. The Yankees have prevailed in eight of the previous encounters. The Dodgers are now three wins away from claiming their eighth World Series crown, with the two teams set to meet again Saturday in Los Angeles for Game 2 in the best-of-seven series.

Inter Miami beats Atlanta United in Lionel Messi’s MLS playoff debut,"Ben Morse,CNN","6:43 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",3 minute,"Sports,Football","Inter Miami beat Atlanta United 2-1 on Friday in what was Lionel Messi’s Major League Soccer (MLS) playoff debut. It was two of his former Barcelona teammates who got the goals, with Luis Suárez opening the scoring in the second minute and Jordi Alba’s long-range strike on the hour mark sealing the victory, with Messi himself providing the assist. Saba Lobzhanidze had equalized for Atlanta in the 39th minute, but the stunning 25-yard effort from Inter Miami’s left back provided the decisive goal. The win gives Miami a one-game lead in the best-of-three first round series of the MLS playoffs, with Game 2 being played on November 2 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. “It’s not easy to find fullbacks who are so decisive, who contribute so much to the offensive game of the team – Dani Alves, Cafu, Marcelo, Roberto Carlos, they’re all at that level,” Miami head coach Gerardo Martino said afterwards, per MLS, about Alba’s impact on the team. “Technically, he has a quality that is very rare in a wide defender, and is better when he understands where Luis and Leo are and can find them, and how they can find him, if they can find Jordi. For sure, it is difficult to find a player who plays in his position and is as decisive.” Although Messi didn’t find the back of the net, the Argentine was prominently involved throughout the game at Chase Stadium, contributing the assist for Alba’s game-winning goal and troubling the Atlanta goal consistently. The 37-year-old drew numerous saves from Atlanta’s goalkeeper Brad Guzan, as well as striking the post midway through the first half. His assist for Alba’s second-half strike – Alba’s fifth goal of the season – was Messi’s 17th this year. The victory was the perfect start to the postseason for Miami which enters with plenty of pressure riding on its shoulders. Not only does it have a star-studded squad laden with veteran talent, but it entered the playoffs as the No. 1 overall seed after a successful regular season where it lost just four times on the way to 74 points, the most in the league. “It was a match where what I liked the most was the control we had on the field for almost the entire game,” Martino said afterwards, per Inter Miami. “We didn’t make many mistakes that would allow the opponent to break out into space. “We had five clear chances in the first half, and one of them came very close to the post. We were patient. I believe that if it weren’t for Brad (Guzan)’s performance, the match should have ended with a clear difference.” Atlanta had advanced to this stage of the MLS playoffs after beating Montreal on penalties in the wild card round."
Commonwealth leaders say ‘time has come’ for discussion on UK slavery reparations,ory by Reuters,"10:22 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",3 minute,,"Commonwealth leaders, ending a week-long summit in Samoa, said on Saturday the time had come for a discussion on whether Britain should commit to reparations for its role in the transatlantic slave trade. Slavery and the threat of climate change were major themes for representatives of the 56 countries in the group, most with roots in Britain’s empire, at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting that began in the Pacific Islands nation on Monday. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whose country has long rejected calls for financial compensation for nations affected by slavery, said summit discussions were not “about money.” On slavery, the leaders said in a joint statement they had “agreed that the time has come for a meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation towards forging a common future based on equity.” The push for ex-colonial powers such as Britain to pay reparations or make other amends for slavery and its legacies has gained momentum worldwide, particularly among the Caribbean Community and the African Union. The statement also made reference to “blackbirding”, a term for people from places including the Pacific Islands being deceived, coerced or kidnapped to work on plantations in Australia and elsewhere. Those opposed to reparations say countries should not be held responsible for historical wrongs, while those in support say the legacy of slavery has led to vast and persistent racial inequality. The joint statement did not mention what form reparations should take. Starmer told a press conference the joint statement did two things: “It notes calls for discussion and it agrees that this is the time for a conversation. “But I should be really clear here, in the two days we’ve been here, none of the discussions have been about money. Our position is very, very clear in relation to that,” he said. Professor Kingsley Abbott, director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at the University of London, said the statement was a sign of a potentially historic breakthrough on the issue. “The commitment to conversations on reparatory justice wedges open the door for dialogue, and now the hard work really begins,” said Abbott, who attended the summit. The joint statement also referred to concern about “the severe consequences of the climate crisis, including rising temperatures and sea levels.” In a boost for Pacific Islands such as Tuvalu under threat from rising seas, they issued the Commonwealth’s first Oceans Declaration, affirming that a nation’s maritime boundaries should remain fixed even if climate change causes small island states to be submerged. Fixing maritime boundaries means atoll nations can continue to reap the economic benefit of vast fishing grounds, even if populations must migrate as dry land area is significantly reduced. The declaration bolsters momentum for international law to recognise the perpetual statehood of sinking island states. More than half of the Commonwealth’s members are small nations, many of them low-lying islands at risk from rising sea levels caused by climate change."
Man sentenced to life after ‘catfishing’ at least 70 minors and driving a 12-year-old to take her own life,"Abel Alvarado,CNN","2:06 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",2 minute,"World,United Kingdom","A man in Northern Ireland has been sentenced to life for several crimes, including manslaughter, after using social media sites to blackmail and sexually abuse at least 70 minors in several countries. Alexander McCartney, 26, was sentenced by a judge at Belfast Crown Court on Friday for child sexual offenses, blackmail and the manslaughter of a 12-year-old girl who took her own life in the United States in 2018 after being “catfished,” according to a statement from Northern Ireland’s Public Prosecution Service (PPS). Catfishing – often used on social media - is when a person uses false information and images to create a fake identity online with the intention of tricking, harassing, or scamming another person. According to authorities, McCartney pretended to be a young girl, befriended victims on social media and manipulated them into sending him nude images of themselves. The victims were then threatened “into sending him indecent images and videos of themselves, forcing them to engage in depraved and sometimes dangerous sexual acts,” the statement said. McCartney – who targeted around 3,500 girls from Northern Ireland, Ireland, Great Britain, the US and New Zealand – sought to “exploit that vulnerability in the most shocking ways,” acting head of the PPS Serious Crime Unit Catherine Kierans said. “All McCartney’s victims were young, innocent children” as young as 10 years old and “struggling with identity and body image issues and had reached out for help on social media,” Kierans said. In total, McCartney pleaded guilty to 185 charges involving 70 victims. McCartney must serve a minimum of 20 years in prison before he can be considered for parole. “Tragically, one of his young victims, who was just 12, had taken her own life during an online chat in which he was threatening her and forcing her to engage in sexual activity,” Kierans noted. She said that the girl, an American, and McCartney never met in person. CNN affiliate Virgin Media News reported that McCartney mainly used the popular social media app Snapchat to target his victims. In a statement shared with CNN, Snapchat said the “sexual exploitation of any person is horrific and illegal, and our hearts go out to the victims in this case.” “If we discover this activity, or it is reported to us, we remove it, lock the violating account and report it to the authorities,” the social media site said. It added that the app has “extra protections for teens to make it difficult for them to be contacted by strangers.” The PPS is working to identify more of McCartney’s victims, according to its statement."
Groundbreaking telescope reveals first piece of new cosmic map,"Jackie Wattles,CNN","11:00 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",4 minute,,"Editor’s note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Greetings, earthlings! I’m Jackie Wattles, and I’m thrilled to be a new name bringing awe to your inbox. I’ve covered space exploration for nearly a decade at CNN, and there has never been a more exciting time to follow space and science discoveries. As researchers push forward to explore and understand the cosmos, advancements in technology are sparking rapid developments in rocketry, astronomical observatories and a multitude of scientific instruments. Look no further than the missions racing to unlock dark matter and the mysterious force known as dark energy, both so named precisely because science has yet to explain these phenomena. Astronomers have never detected dark matter, but they believe it makes up about 85% of the total matter in the universe. Meanwhile, the existence of dark energy helps researchers explain why the universe is expanding — and why that expansion is speeding up. Extraordinary new scientific instruments are churning out trailblazing data, ready to reshape how scientists view the cosmos. A prime example is the European Space Agency’s wide-angle Euclid telescope that launched in 2023 to investigate the riddles of dark energy and dark matter. Euclid this week delivered the first piece of a cosmic map — containing about 100 million stars and galaxies — that will take six years to create. These stunning 3D observations may help scientists see how dark matter warps light and curves space across galaxies. Meanwhile, on a mountaintop in northern Chile, the US National Science Foundation and Stanford University researchers are preparing to power up the world’s largest digital camera inside the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. In the mountains of Uzbekistan, a research team used lasers strapped to a flying robot to uncover two cities buried and lost for centuries. The anthropologists said they had mapped these forgotten medieval towns for the first time — located at a key crossroad of ancient silk trade routes — using a drone equipped with LiDAR, or light detection and ranging equipment. When nature reclaims what’s left of once thriving civilizations, scientists are increasingly turning to remote sensing to peer through dense vegetation. The images revealed two large settlements dotted with watchtowers, fortresses, complex buildings, plazas and pathways that tens of thousands of people may have called home. Remember the citizen astronauts who took a SpaceX capsule on a daring ride into a radiation belt and carried out the first private spacewalk in September? Those thrill-seeking explorers, otherwise known as the Polaris Dawn crew, spoke to CNN about some of the uncomfortable medical issues they experienced in space — a stark reminder that the human body is not designed for microgravity. Blurred vision, nausea and vomiting were among the symptoms the four-person crew reported. But these issues weren’t unexpected. As part of the mission, the group carried out research that aims to understand and treat space-related ailments. Researchers have long known an 800-year-old tale about a dead man thrown into a well at Sverresborg Castle in Norway. Tossing the body was likely part of an attempt to poison the water supply during a gruesome military raid, the Sverris saga explains. Now, DNA analysis is allowing scientists to corroborate the story in a stunning marriage of history and legend with science and technology. Researchers initially uncovered the bones of a person dubbed “Well-man” near the castle in 1938. But only now, using advanced gene-sequencing technology, has a study team been able to etch out a clearer picture of who the man was — and the findings revealed an unexpected twist. At least two species of firefly glimmered in the night sky in the Mesozoic Era, according to new research. That means dinosaurs may have witnessed the soft evening glow emitted by the bioluminescent insects. Building on a past analysis of the first firefly species identified from that era, initially described in 2015, a separate team of scientists investigated another 99 million-year-old firefly trapped in tree resin. This specimen, found in northern Myanmar in 2016, may help researchers better understand how fireflies evolved the ability to glow at least 100 million years ago. Scientists are only now beginning to glean the evolution of these captivating creatures because their soft bodies are so difficult to preserve in the fossil record. Check out these can’t-miss reads: — A gargantuan meteorite estimated to be four times the size of Mount Everest struck Earth 3.2 billion years ago. The space rock boiled oceans, but scientists now believe the strike’s aftereffects may have jump-started conditions for recovering life to thrive. — Four astronauts who rode home aboard a SpaceX capsule on Friday were unexpectedly sent to a Florida medical facility. Three crew members were discharged, but one remained hospitalized with a “medical issue” that NASA hasn’t disclosed. — The two Boeing Starliner astronauts weren’t on that mission. Here’s why they couldn’t catch the first flight back to Earth. — Even if sky-gazers missed the peak of the Orionid meteor shower this week, there is still a chance to observe the annual celestial display and plenty of other cosmic phenomena on the horizon.

She connected on Instagram with a guy who lived in another country. Then they decided to meet up,"Francesca Street,CNN","7:54 AM EDT, Fri October 25, 2024",17 minute,,"Amanda Boyce stumbled across Sunil Rajput’s Instagram profile by accident. Sitting in her home in Brisbane, Australia, Amanda was absentmindedly scrolling social media. As she flicked through Instagram stories — one after the other, snapshots of different people’s lives popping up on her phone screen — she suddenly found herself looking at Sunil for the first time. An account Amanda followed had shared one of Sunil’s posts to their Instagram story. Amanda clicked through and the photo — of Sunil smiling at the camera — enlarged on her phone. “Wow, he’s good looking,” she thought. Then she scrolled down his page — posts about fitness, travel, his life in India. He seems interesting, Amanda thought. Without overthinking it, Amanda hit follow. It was early 2018. Amanda, then 27, was feeling a little disillusioned and unsatisfied with her everyday life in Australia. “I had gone through some traumatic situations in the years prior, and I was just feeling a bit lost in my life in Brisbane,” Amanda tells CNN Travel today. “I had a full-time job, but I didn’t have my own home, any kids, no pets. I didn’t really have a purpose, so I found myself just like scrolling Instagram a lot, and then I found Sunil’s page…and really didn’t know what I was expecting, honestly.” Amanda started liking Sunil’s posts whenever they popped up on her feed. She almost always looked at his stories. She enjoyed seeing snippets of Sunil’s life – flashes of him going out with friends, cooking, working out. “And then one day, he just randomly messaged me,” she recalls. Amanda and Sunil started chatting, messaging back and forth on Instagram, introducing themselves, talking a little about their lives. And then Sunil suggested they chat on the phone. It was early evening in India, a little later into the night in Brisbane, Australia. Amanda was a little apprehensive at first, but then she figured, if it was awkward, or Sunil wasn’t who he said he was, she’d just hang up. But as soon as Sunil’s voice answered the call, Amanda felt “really comfortable and safe.” The two strangers talked for hours, sharing details about their lives, their past relationships, their hopes and dreams. “It felt really nice to connect and talk to someone so openly about my whole life,” says Amanda. “But then the next day, I panicked and I thought, ‘I don’t know why I’m investing my time in someone that lives 10,000 kilometers away.’ I felt like I made a mistake about being too open with someone I didn’t really know.” Amanda felt embarrassed — almost guilty. “So I kind of ghosted him,” she says. “He kept trying to message and check in with me, but I didn’t really reply.” Amanda tried to put Sunil out of her mind. But their conversation had sparked an idea. Amanda had always wanted to visit India and a good friend of hers had recently moved there. “I decided I wanted to book a trip to come to India and meet my friend,” she recalls. “So I booked my flights.” By coincidence, Amanda’s friend lived in the same city as Sunil — Chandigarh, in northern India. But Amanda wasn’t going in the hope of bumping into Sunil. Chandigarh’s pretty big, with a population spanning around 1.1 million in 2018. “I just had this calling to come to India,” says Amanda. “I wanted to do a bit of soul searching. A bit of ‘Eat, Pray, Love,’ if you will.” Amanda arrived in Chandigarh in the spring of 2018. She started posting Instagram updates — photos of meals out, views, snapshots posing with her friend. And then she got a message: “Wait, you’re in my city?” wrote Sunil. Amanda didn’t reply right away. “I kind of brushed it off and thought, ‘Oh, I’m not going to have time to meet him. I’m just here to meet friends,’” recalls Amanda. But then, towards the end of the visit, Amanda’s friend unexpectedly had to head out of town. Suddenly with time to kill, Amanda figured it might be worth contacting Sunil — they’d got on so well on the phone, after all. Now she was in India, the distance didn’t feel so daunting. And Sunil seemed to have forgiven Amanda for the temporary ghosting. So Amanda suggested the two of them meet for lunch. “I wanted to meet in a public place, because I was meeting someone from the internet in a foreign country where I couldn’t speak the language,” she says. Amanda was also vague about where she was staying — and about the fact her friend was now out of town. She was conscious that Sunil was essentially a stranger. But as soon as Amanda saw Sunil in person, her fears were calmed. “I just had this warm, comfortable, safe feeling,” she says. “And it was all a bit exciting as well.” In 2018, Sunil Rajput was a twentysomething living in Chandigarh, working in the liquor industry and spending most of his free time in the gym or traveling. He was single and not consciously looking for a relationship. But when Amanda arrived in his life out of the blue, Sunil was instantly intrigued. He vividly remembers the first moment her name popped up on his screen, his phone notifying him he had a new follower. “I thought, ‘Wow, she’s pretty,’” Sunil tells CNN Travel today. “We started texting, and then we had the long conversation on the call. We shared a lot — sensitive conversation, our normal lives, romantic stuff, everything. We really opened up.” Then, radio silence. “I was like, ‘What’s happening? She’s not talking to me anymore.’ And then, all of a sudden, I’m seeing her on Instagram in India, and I felt like, ‘Why didn’t she tell me?’” When Sunil realized Amanda was in his city, he debated whether to get back in touch. “Should I let my ego down?” he wondered. Sunil hesitated, but he kept thinking back over their phone conversation. The way they’d connected on such a deep level. It felt like something worth exploring. And he realized that he was “actually looking for love, stability.” So, Sunil dropped Amanda a message. And when Amanda replied, suggesting meeting up for lunch, Sunil decided he wanted to “do something special for her.” He suggested that — if Amanda was comfortable — he’d make her lunch at his apartment. Amanda didn’t say no, but suggested they meet in a public space first. When Sunil saw Amanda in person, he was struck by how surreal the moment was. Externally, he tried to play it cool, but he recalls his heart beating fast as she approached. “I was talking to this person, never expecting I’d meet her, now she’s standing in front of me,” he says.  “My emotions were all over the place. Deep down, I was crying with happiness that she was here. But I was trying to act low-key.” Amanda agreed to go to Sunil’s home for lunch, and he was excited to have the opportunity to demonstrate his cooking skills. “I made Amanda some chicken curry, Indian style,” he says. “We had a nice lunch and spent a good time, we talked a lot.” “I was really impressed by the effort he went to on our first meet-up/date,” says Amanda. “He picked me up, cooked me lunch, took me to the local temple which is famous in his area and then went out for drinks. He was very respectful and dropped me back to my hotel as soon as I was ready.” Amanda and Sunil parted that night excited to potentially meet again. A couple days later, they went out together for a second time. “We drank, danced a lot, and were really comfortable together,” says Sunil. For Amanda, it was that evening that made her start to seriously consider, “What is this? Could this be it? What if this is what I’ve been looking for?” Earlier that year, Amanda’s therapist had encouraged her to write all the traits and qualities she was looking for in a partner on a whiteboard. In Chandigarh, Amanda kept getting flashbacks to the whiteboard and her list, which included values like family, fitness, food, respect for others, respecting boundaries, and communication. “Sunil basically ticked all of the qualities,” says Amanda. “It was almost like I’d manifested the whole situation.” As for Sunil, he was pretty swept away by Amanda, too. “I was ready to start something,” he says. “I wanted to see her again. But I didn’t know if it could actually happen. I didn’t know if I’d ever go to Australia or anything.” Sunil decided to just ensure he and Amanda created “the best memories” while she was in India. “And I figured if it was meant to be, somehow we’ll meet again,” he says.

      He told his mother there was ‘no way’ he’d meet someone in Australia. Then he fell in love at first sight Amanda returned to Australia, but she and Sunil stayed in touch. More long phone conversations followed, and regular messages back and forth. “We were talking every day,” Amanda recalls. “And then Sunil said, ‘I want to get to know you a bit better. Do you want to come back to India?’ So I booked flights for June, about two months after my first trip.” Amanda and Sunil started counting down the days — but when Amanda boarded her flight, the nerves hit and she found herself a little apprehensive. “I did start to panic a little bit. I thought to myself, ‘What happens if I get there and my feelings have changed?’” recalls Amanda. “But then I walked out at the airport and saw him standing there. It was summer, 40 degrees (over 100 degrees Fahrenheit) in the middle of Delhi. But Sunil was holding roses and my favorite chocolate, which was melting in the heat. I walked out and saw him and I thought, ‘No, this is the right decision.’” “It felt really special,” says Sunil of the moment he saw Amanda again, at Indira Gandhi International Airport. “The idea that somebody came all the way from a different country, to see me…” This time around, Sunil took time off work and “took Amanda everywhere.” He wanted to impress her, win her over, spend as much time with her as he could. “I took her to mountains, to the Himalayas to go trekking, on road trips, singing songs in the car for her, and karaoke sessions,” he recalls. “It was really memorable. I remember thinking, ‘If this doesn’t work out, I don’t know if I’ll ever put this much effort into something with anybody else.’” One evening, sitting close to Sunil at a rooftop bar surveying the bustling city below, Amanda told Sunil she wanted to move to India. “I said I wanted to move in 12 months’ time — that I knew that’s where I wanted to be,” Amanda recalls. “It was a drunken night. But I meant it. We started talking about our future and what we wanted.” That night, Amanda and Sunil agreed marriage was important to them, that they wanted to start a new chapter of their life together. “I was really happy,” says Sunil. “But also a little panicked. I was used to living life alone, enjoying my freedom and everything.” He was also concerned Amanda would change her mind about living in India. But the next day, when the alcohol haze had worn off, Amanda told Sunil she was sincere about what she’d said. And Sunil found himself thinking that “life would be better if she was here all the time.” He even gave her a ring — it didn’t have to be an engagement ring, he said, if Amanda wasn’t ready yet. But it was a promise. “A promise that we are always going to be together,” says Sunil today. This time, when Amanda returned to Australia, she promised she’d return. And back in Brisbane, Amanda told her friends and her mother she’d met someone, and she was going to move to India to be with him. There were more than a few raised eyebrows — many of her loved ones worried things had moved too quickly, that Amanda didn’t really know Sunil. And Amanda was greeted with more concern when, in August 2018, she and Sunil got engaged on vacation in Thailand. “It was a fairly quick engagement,” admits Amanda. “I did have a few people question if I was making the right choice, if I was rushing into things.” Amanda understood their concerns, but she and Sunil were confident in their decision-making, and in their commitment to each other. And Sunil offered to speak to Amanda’s mother on the phone, to reassure her and get to know her a little from afar. “My mom asked him all the different questions — what were his intentions and things like that,” says Amanda. “And afterwards, she felt really comfortable, she was fine.” “My parents were really worried too,” admits Sunil. “We are really into religion and culture and they questioned, ‘How are you going to do it with a person from a different country, different culture and everything?’” But Sunil told them he knew Amanda was the right person for him. “And they trusted me,” Sunil says. “I’ve always been really independent.” In Thailand, Sunil proposed to Amanda while they were on a night river cruise in Bangkok. Beforehand, he’d worried about how to actually go about it. “In my culture, we don’t do this sitting on a knee proposing thing,” Sunil explains. “And with the boat, I thought I had to do a romantic, ‘Titanic’ type thing.” But Sunil put his nerves to one side, and gave Amanda the ring. She said yes. They kissed. Another passenger snapped a few surreptitious photos, which she later passed on to the couple. “It was an amazing night under the sky and on the water. It was beautiful, and we spent a great time in Thailand,” says Sunil. “We did all the adventurous stuff together. We went to multiple bars and clubs and some days we were chilling next to the beach. Explored markets, shopping and saw so many temples.” Related article
      Two strangers met in Berlin. Here’s how they ended up having ‘three weddings’ Following the engagement, Amanda and Sunil decided they would wait a year before Amanda moved to India permanently. This was what she’d suggested at the rooftop bar, after all — and it allowed a bit of time for the couple to continue to get to know each other. “I did have a tendency to make decisions in the moment and not really think,” says Amanda. “So I thought if I move to India after a year, then it’ll give me time to make sure this is exactly what I want.” In the meantime, Amanda and Sunil navigated a long distance relationship, meeting in person when they could. “The long distance was really tough,” says Amanda. “Trying to find ways to stay connected that wasn’t repetitive.” And when they were apart, Sunil often worried Amanda would change her mind. “It’s a big decision, moving your entire life to a different country,” he says. “I thought she would one day wake up and think, ‘Maybe I won’t.’” But by the following summer, Amanda was preparing to leave Australia, to relocate permanently. She gave in her notice at the insurance company where she worked. “I was quitting my job. I had to sell all my belongings. I was leaving my family behind,” she recalls. “And then in August 2019, I moved to India, to Chandigarh, to Sunil’s apartment — the one I visited on that first trip when he cooked me lunch.” “My apartment turned into a proper home,” says Sunil. The first several weeks together in India were a “honeymoon period,” as Amanda puts it. “But when I realized that it wasn’t a holiday, that I had moved there, it was harder,” she admits. “Not the relationship, but I couldn’t speak the language, I didn’t have any friends.” Amanda’s friend who lived in Chandigarh had since moved to Canada. Amanda knew no one, other than Sunil. He reassured Amanda she would soon settle. “It’s only been two months,” he pointed out. The couple decided to get a dog, whose presence comforted Amanda. Looking after the dog brought Amanda and Sunil even closer together. And then, a few months after Amanda moved to India, she and Sunil got married. This was a special weekend for many reasons, not least of which because Amanda and Sunil’s families got to meet for the first time. “My parents, my sister and her partner, and my brother and his partner, they all came over for two weeks, and I had a couple of friends come over too,” says Amanda. “For me it was the happiest time of my life. I remember sitting on stage at one of my ceremonies, getting my mehndi applied on my hands and feet and watching Sunil’s family encouraging my family to dance and enjoy themselves.” The two families had a language barrier — but their shared happiness was universal. “Sunil’s parents don’t speak any English, my family don’t know any Hindi, yet language didn’t matter,” says Amanda. “Actions, hand gestures and emotions were all that was needed and when my family said goodbye to Sunil’s family every single person was crying.” The wedding weekend included four different ceremonies and celebrations – from cocktail parties to prayer ceremonies. Amanda loved wearing her gold and red wedding dress. “She looked amazing,” says Sunil. “Like she came out of the sky or something. It was a really unbelievable experience. I was really stressed out in the lead up. But I had a big fat smile on my face that day. I was so happy.” In time, the couple became especially grateful for this day spent with family and loved ones. Only a few months after Amanda and Sunil’s wedding, the coronavirus pandemic shut down international travel and visiting Australia was out of the question. 2020 was characterized by a “big unknown feeling,” as Amanda puts it. And then, in 2021, Covid cases skyrocketed in India. “It was scary,” says Amanda. “The pandemic was really, really bad here.” Amid this fear and uncertainty, Amanda and Sunil hunkered down with each other and their dog. “It definitely helped having each other, being close,” says Amanda. “That’s also when I learned how to cook Indian food.” Once the pandemic waned, the two adopted a second dog. And once Amanda and Sunil were able to travel and go out more, life became more stable. Sunil suggests going through the pandemic in the immediate aftermath of their wedding “made us a really different and a better version of ourselves.” “We learned to love, we learned to live, we learned how to sacrifice and have patience and how to create a family,” he says.

      Two hikers encountered a rattlesnake. Then they fell in love Today, Amanda and Sunil are still living in Chandigarh – now in a slightly larger apartment, and now with three dogs in tow. “I really feel like this is home,” says Amanda. “I feel really settled. And I feel really happy to be here, and very satisfied with how everything’s turned out. We’re finally able to travel and do things, we’re both doing really well in our own businesses – I think we live a really nice, comfortable, happy life.” Amanda now runs a teaching business called “Aussie English with Amanda.” As well as teaching frequent classes, she has also produced two online courses — one on Australian English and the other focusing on Aussie slang. She also posts work updates on her Instagram account. Sunil says it’s been inspiring to watch Amanda develop her business, and he values her input in his career too, describing how they “help each other a lot.” “Sunil has never stopped encouraging me from working and growing,” says Amanda. “When I started developing my online course and I was so busy that I was even forgetting to eat, he would cook me dinner and bring it to me even at 10 p.m.” When they’re not focusing on their jobs, Amanda and Sunil enjoy working out together and exploring the beautiful nature on their doorstep in northern India. “The gym and training is something that we bonded over early, in the beginning. We still go to the gym together,” says Amanda. “And we like doing outdoor activities, traveling – we’re very close to the Himalayan Mountains, just a few hours away. So we like to go up there and do the hikes through the mountains.” On more chilled weekends, Amanda and Sunil take turns taking each other to favorite coffee shops or restaurants. They really enjoy “treating each other,” as Sunil puts it. In the future, the couple hopes to own a vacation home in Australia. They’d love to have children and travel the world as a family. But for now, they’re focused on enjoying their present happiness — and occasionally reflecting on how they got here. “It honestly still feels so unbelievable at times,” says Amanda, of their unlikely Instagram-based love story. “I just followed this complete stranger because he was good looking.” Amanda never imagined she’d be happily married to Sunil, but she’s so glad that’s how life panned out. “It’s so crazy to think that it was six-and-a-half years ago that we connected, and I came for that first trip, and now we’re here.” “You look back and it still feels like you’re surprised, you get goosebumps and everything, how it happened,” agrees Sunil. “It’s a movie story for me.” For Sunil and Amanda, the message of the story is “life is always giving you chances out there. You just have to accept them,” as Sunil puts it. “I feel like sometimes we are too scared — always protecting our heart because of whatever we’ve gone through in our past, and because of that, sometimes we end up losing out on the great things,” he says. “My message is simple: keep your heart open. No matter what you’re going through, you’re going to bump into something really great. “And if it’s not great, it means you still need more time to learn from it, and then you become stronger, and someday, sooner or later, you’re going to bump into something really nice, and it will change everything, and it will make everything work out.”"

Tiny house with elaborate – and erotic – frescoes unearthed at Pompeii,"Issy Ronald,Sharon Braithwaite,CNN","9:15 AM EDT, Fri October 25, 2024",2 minute,"Style,Arts","Archaeologists have uncovered a tiny house in Pompeii that is filled with elaborate – and sometimes erotic – frescoes, further revealing the ornate way in which Romans decorated their homes. Situated in the central district of the ancient city, the house is smaller than normal and unusually lacks the open central courtyard – known as an atrium – that is typical of Roman architecture, the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, which oversees the site, said in a statement Thursday. This change could have occurred due to shifting trends in Roman - and particularly Pompeian - society, during the first century AD, archaeologists said. Pompeii was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 when its buildings and thousands of inhabitants were buried beneath layers of ash and pumice. This coating perfectly preserved the city for millennia, making it one of the most important archaeological sites in the world as it offers an unprecedented insight into Roman daily life. This latest discovery spotlights the ornate decorations that rich Romans enjoyed in their homes – several frescoes depict mythical scenes and others are decorated with plant and animal motifs on a white background. One small square painting set against a blue-painted wall depicts intercourse between a satyr and a nymph, while another shows Hippolytus, son of the mythical Greek king Theseus, and his stepmother Phaedra who fell in love with him before killing herself when he rejected her in disgust. One fresco likely portrays the Judgement of Paris, though it has been damaged by previous excavations, and another shows Venus, the goddess of love, and Adonis, her mortal lover. Erotic and elaborate frescoes like this have been uncovered in Pompeii before. One house covered in erotic frescoes reopened to the public in January 2023 after being closed for 20 years while another fresco depicting an erotic scene from the Greek myth “Leda and the Swan” was uncovered in 2018. Elsewhere in this newly excavated house, the last ritual offerings left before the eruption still remain at the household shrine, known as a lararium. “We have archaeologists, restorers, archaeobotanists here to understand exactly how the ritual of the last sacrifice was carried out before the eruption,” said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the park’s director, in a statement.  “There are still the burnt remains of this ritual, there is the knife that was used.” This excavation, Zuchtriegel added, “takes place under the eyes of the public” who can access the site on suspended walkways and watch archaeologists working."
Most space travelers face the same debilitating ailment. The experience of 4 civilian astronauts could offer answers,"Jackie Wattles,CNN","5:01 PM EDT, Fri October 25, 2024",6 minute,"Science,Space","Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Each of the four crew members aboard SpaceX’s Polaris Dawn mission reported different physical sensations during their history-making trip, which sent the private astronauts into a higher orbit around Earth than any human has ventured in decades. “My vision acuity started to deteriorate those first few days,” Scott “Kidd” Poteet, a former US Air Force pilot, told CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a recent interview. His crewmate Anna Menon, a SpaceX engineer who was the Polaris Dawn mission’s medical officer, said she was struck by space adaptation syndrome. It’s a phenonmenon that affects roughly 60% to 80% of people who travel to orbit, though astronauts rarely openly discuss the ailment. “It can be a whole spectrum of experience from lightheadedness, nausea, all the way to vomiting,” Menon said. “I experienced really the whole gamut.” Traveling to space — with its jarring g-forces and disorienting weightlessness — can have a variety of effects on the human body, ranging from the uncomfortable to the downright dangerous. NASA has long known about and studied these ailments, as the agency’s astronauts have reported such symptoms for decades. But the Polaris Dawn mission — a five-day journey to orbit carried out by the private sector rather than NASA — sought to take that research further, hoping to unravel some of the most troublesome aspects of spaceflight. During the mission, the crew carried out a variety of health-focused experiments, including wearing special contact lenses that measured the pressure in their eyes and undergoing MRI scans to track changes to the anatomy of their brains. The Polaris Dawn team pursued those answers because the mission aims to pave the way for more people to venture into space, noted Jared Isaacman, the billionaire founder of payment technology company Shift4. Isaacman helped fund and was commander of the unprecedented mission. “Some 600 people have been to orbit in the last 60 years — more than half have gotten space adaptation syndrome,” Isaacman said. “And you’re talking about (mostly government astronauts) — some of the most highly screened individuals. … That’s just underscoring the importance of why we have to solve this, if we’re going to put hundreds or thousands of people in space one day.” SpaceX’s founding goal is to fly the first humans to Mars and eventually establish a settlement there. “If you think of a future where there’s thousands of people living in space and they eventually — after nine months’ travel — you get to the surface of Mars, and a huge percentage (of people) have vision changes that make them unable to do their work, unable to read their procedures — that’s a big problem,” Menon said of why SpaceX hopes to find answers to pressing in-space medical conditions. During the September mission, the Polaris Dawn crew conducted the first commercial spacewalk as well as ventured into the lower band of Earth’s Van Allen radiation belts, which are areas within Earth’s magnetic field where pools of radiation from the sun lie trapped. Initial reports from the Polaris Dawn crew did not necessarily reveal any specific health effects from radiation exposure, although Isaacman said he saw “sparkles or lights” when he closed as eyes, just as other NASA astronauts who have ventured through high-radiation environments have reported. This phenomenon is not yet well understood. However, Poteet said his vision was noticeably less sharp during the first few days in space, which may point to a condition called spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome, or SANS. NASA estimates as many as 70% of astronauts experience this condition, which may be caused by shifting bodily fluid, resulting in pressure changes in the eyes. Poteet’s vision changes may have shown up in the data collected by the special contact lenses worn by the crew, which they nicknamed the “cyborg experiment.” The contacts were designed to collect data on interocular pressure over the course of their mission, Menon said. “This is novel because you’re getting long-duration data. And you can then really better understand how that transition occurs over the course of time and especially that early time in space,” she said. “We are really interested to see what the researchers come back with when they have the chance to look through all this data.” Dr. Allison Hayman, a researcher and associate professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, which led the cyborg experiment, said Friday that researchers had not yet received preliminary data from the mission. In all, the Polaris Dawn team carried out 36 experiments on behalf of 31 partner institutions, including universities and NASA. Back on Earth, Poteet reported that his vision quickly returned to normal. And while he had unfortunate vision lapses during the journey, Poteet said he was pleased to report he did not experience any of the nausea typically associated with space adaptation syndrome, which he called “fairly ironic.” “People assume there’s a correlation between motion sickness (on Earth) and space adaptation syndrome,” he said. “I have a tendency to get motion sickness in the back of an Uber. … But I actually didn’t experience those symptoms (in space).” Menon noted she wasn’t as lucky. “It really gave me just a huge appreciation for how it can impact your ability to work and get things done, especially in those early adaptation days,” Menon said. Before takeoff, Isaacman — the only crew member with previous space travel experience — told CNN that medication administered to treat space adaptation syndrome symptoms can put people to sleep for eight hours or so. (He led a previous self-funded trip to orbit called Inspiration4 in 2021.) Sarah Gillis, a lead SpaceX operations engineer who was a mission specialist aboard Polaris Dawn, also noted that crew members had their blood drawn before and after the mission to evaluate how their bodies processed drugs — such as acetaminophen (or Tylenol) — in orbit versus on Earth. Another experiment that the Polaris Dawn crew underwent to understand in-space ailments involved a series of MRI scans just before liftoff and immediately after returning to Earth. The crew even had a portable imaging machine right outside their quarantine facility, Isaacman said. Doing so allowed the team to collect data even faster than NASA has collected such scans on astronauts after returning from space, Menon said. “Even those MRI results show changes to the brain anatomy,” she said. The changes have included brains shifting upward in astronauts’ skulls, according to Dr. Donna Roberts, deputy chief scientist at the ISS National Laboratory who has spent years researching the affects of spaceflight on brain structure. Roberts on Thursday noted that initial reviews of the MRI data “did not show any clinically concerning findings.” Spaceflight can also enlarge fluid-filled cavities at the center of the brain, called ventricles, Roberts added. “We don’t quite understand why that’s happening,” she said. Gillis, whose job at SpaceX includes training NASA astronauts headed for orbit, said in a CNN interview before liftoff that “human spaceflight is not going to be glamorous all the time” because of the discomfort microgravity can wreak on the human body. Upon her return, Gillis reflected on the effects. “It’s been so incredibly fascinating to actually go through all of those changes to see how your body responds, and how the fluid shift impacts you, and how all of your organs kind of shift inside you,” she said. “We don’t thrive without atmosphere, without oxygen,” Gillis added. “I think that really just underscores the importance to me of the research we are doing, the data we’re collecting.”"
A ring found among the debris of Florida’s recent hurricanes awaits its owner,"Alaa Elassar,CNN","6:00 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",4 minute,,"Scattered across Florida’s hurricane-ravaged communities are piles of debris, remnants of what were once homes. Cherished memories — photo albums, family heirlooms, and tokens of love — swallowed by floodwaters and carried miles away, are now reduced to mere fragments and discarded amid the wreckage. But in one of these piles of lost memories, a small, inconspicuous velvet black box was discovered with a ring and a note that read: “I was 18 when my parents gave it to me.” Now, Joe Kovach, the engineer managing one of the debris sites in Tarpon Springs, Florida, where the box was found, is searching for its owner. “Everyone has been basically dumping their entire lives onto the curb after the storm when everything flooded. My own boss’ house had 30 inches (of water) in it, and I saw his face and just how devastating it can be for everyone,” Kovach, an engineer with Pinellas County Public Works, told CNN. “A lot of people in the community were really affected by these two storms, if there’s just a little bit I can do to give back, then that’s perfect.” A contractor, who was gathering and condensing debris with an excavator, discovered the ring when he looked down and saw the box. “This was a needle in a haystack for sure. For something like that to survive all that when everything else was so wet and saturated, that was kind of incredible,” Kovach said. Although the ring was found after Hurricane Milton, Kovach is sure the treasure was initially lost amid the ruins of Hurricane Helene, based on the pile of debris it came from, which Pinellas County Public Works tracks. It is likely the owner of the ring is from Crystal Beach, Ozona, or Palm Harbor, Kovach said. On Tuesday, after the contractor informed him about the ring, Kovach posted a photo of the box and the note on several local community Facebook pages, asking if it belonged to anyone. He did not include a photo or description of the ring to ensure it is returned to the rightful owner who can accurately describe it. On the inside lid of the box is a gold engraving with the jewelry brand, “The Danbury Mint.” Within two days, the post received over 700 reactions, with community members sharing ideas on how Kovach might find the ring’s rightful owner. “The comments were overwhelming at times in a good way,” Kovach said.“The whole community is intrigued and determined to find the owner.” His small act of kindness resonated deeply in a heartbroken community striving to rebuild and find its way forward. Along with widespread death and destruction, two major hurricanes over a short period have left a vast trail of despair and frayed nerves. Hurricane Milton claimed at least 23 lives in Florida, delivering a lethal storm surge, torrential rains and dozens of tornadoes – compounding the suffering inflicted less than two weeks earlier by another “once in a lifetime” storm, Helene, which killed another 20 people as it barreled through the state.

      Milton and Helene are taking a toll on the mental health of Floridians, leaving a trail of anxiety and frayed nerves “This area has never seen anything back-to-back like that,” Kovach said. “Because of the amount of damage that’s along the coastal communities, we’re going to be doing this for quite some time as far as the clean up and collections (of debris) and getting back to normal.” Semitrucks full of storm debris are still coming in, each truck dumping the ruins of people’s lives. Every pile of what looks like broken, soggy trash tells a different story of the family and home it came from. A broken armchair, where someone might have spent most of their evenings with a book. Piles of children’s toys — Barbies and remote-controlled cars and action figures — that won’t be played with again. A fanny pack containing family photos and an arcade game card — and even a Social Security card whose owner Kovach was able to track down. His commitment to reuniting people with their belongings following the hurricanes was inspired by someone else’s act of kindness toward him years ago when he lost his wallet at a concert and the person who found it tracked him down online. “I was so thankful for that, so this is like me paying it forward and just looking out for people,” Kovach said. “Anytime I find things like this, I see what I can do.” So far, Kovach has yet to receive a response from the person who lost their ring, but he hopes that eventually they will — and when they do, he says, he’d like to return their lost treasure in person. “It would be amazing,” Kovach said. “Hopefully we can do a meet and greet just to see the excitement in their face.” Anyone with information about the ring can send Pinellas County officials a direct message on their Facebook page."
Witches walk among us — but they’re not like the fictional ones you grew up with,"Scottie Andrew,CNN","9:29 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",6 minute,,"Elwynn Green’s morning routine is relatively unremarkable, at least at the start. With his wife, Green wakes up his three daughters, makes them breakfast and prepares their lunches. Once they’re shipped off to school, and after he’s had a moment to meditate, he’ll take a walk near his home on Northern Ireland’s rugged Causeway Coast. While he’s out, he’ll typically talk to the wind. Green might feel the air swirl around him or the force of a gust pushing dark clouds into the sky, blotting out the blue. He hears the wind speaking, so he may feel compelled to ask it a question. Sometimes, the wind will answer. He has a similar impulse when he overhears trees whispering to each other or the waves crashing. “For most people in everyday life, that’s a sign of madness,” he said. But Green is a witch, and communing with the world around him is at the heart of his craft. He asks questions of the wind and trees, ancestors and spirits. Sometimes answers never come. But witchcraft, to Green, isn’t about finding answers to life’s big questions (or death’s, for that matter). It’s about finding beauty within the chaos. “Sometimes it’s not about knowing,” Green said. “Knowing is overrated.” The way Green practices witchcraft defies stereotypes of broomstick-wielding, cauldron-toting, pointy-hatted witches. He doesn’t belong to a coven. He’s not Wiccan or pagan, religions that are rooted in witchcraft. He has a few cats, though they’re better suited for snuggling than serving as helpful familiars. There is no one way to be a witch, he said. Tenets and rituals are unique to all who practice. The traits others might find strange only strengthen one’s witchcraft, Green said. “We’ve never belonged,” he told CNN of witches. “If we belonged, we wouldn’t be witches. And so my advice to people about that is, usually, get used to not belonging. It’s a good place to set up shop.” Green is a “hedge witch” who exists in the metaphorical “hedge,” the liminal space between our world and a spiritual realm with which he interacts. His witchcraft is heavily informed by animism, or the belief that everything possesses a spirit. To Green, there’s magic in all things — the air we breathe, the water in the ocean, the animals and plants with which we share our planet. Witchery runs in Green’s family. He was raised by his two aunts, both witches, who shared their house with spirits and encouraged Green to find his magic. Though both have since died, Green said one of his aunts’ spirits occasionally “pops in” for a chat. Andrea Samayoa, meanwhile, wasn’t raised a witch. She came to the craft innocently as a child, when she and her friends would make “potions” with leftover condiments from neighborhood parties. Playing pretend-witches, they’d cast “spells” to make it rain and dance under the moon. “We didn’t know what we were doing at the time,” the Floridian witch said. The practice became more important to her when Catholicism, the religion in which she was raised, started to feel too restrictive. Samayoa said she resists inflexible rules, which is partly the reason why she doesn’t belong to a coven, either. Even in her early 30s, Samayoa retains a carefree approach toward witchcraft. Her “eclectic” interpretation, which pulls from several witchcraft traditions, has very few rules, if any. She even published a spellbook called “Lazy Witchcraft for Crazy, Sh*tty Days,” inspired by the way her chronic illness has impacted how she practices her craft. Green and Samayoa are both full-time witches, proficient in the typical rituals and spells of witchcraft — Green performs a banishing ritual every morning to rid his environment of negative influences, and Samayoa makes a curse-removing wash with herbs, citrus, witch hazel and quartz to keep harm at bay. While they practice witchcraft solo, they’re performing it for an audience. Green and Samayoa are both popular figures on WitchTok, a popular TikTok community whose members share tips for improving their craft with fellow witches of all experience levels. On TikTok, Green, who also hosts a podcast and a Patreon, performs readings using bones and tarot cards for commenters who ask him heavy questions about their love lives, careers and safety of their families. It’s a weighty task, so Green chooses his words carefully. Samayoa, meanwhile, often shares no-nonsense rituals in videos peppered with profanity that require little more than an open mind. (She also sells spell kits.) Earlier this month, she taught her followers how to create a simple protection sigil with pen and paper, which she used to protect her Tampa home from Hurricane Milton. It worked, she said: Her house wasn’t harmed in the storm, though a few pieces of her fence were blown out. WitchTok surged in popularity in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic inflicted extreme stress and uncertainty upon the world. Even in the months before the pandemic upended life as we knew it, witchcraft was on its way to a comeback, partly as a response to societal unrest in the wake of the 2016 election and the #MeToo movement, The Atlantic reported in 2020. Pam Grossman, a pagan witch and scholar, told The Atlantic that “the more frustrated people get, they do often turn to witchcraft,” because the typical channels through which they accomplish things have stopped working. But witches who come to the craft to attain power or control will be disappointed, Green said. Witchcraft is a way of interpreting the world and finding one’s place within it, but there are never easy answers or flawless fixes. “Control within nature doesn’t work — it’s chaos,” he said. “It teaches us.” Being a witch doesn’t require belonging to a coven or nailing a complicated spell, both witches told CNN. Witch-centric media like “Hocus Pocus,” “American Horror Story: Coven” and “Agatha All Along” may show fictional sorceresses brewing potions in cauldrons, making soul-sacrificing pacts and harnessing their magic for dark purposes, but none of that is required to be a witch. One doesn’t even have to understand how magic works to be a witch, Green said: “Just accept that it’s there and use it.” Related article
      The witch isn’t dead: New book explores witchcraft’s rebellious history – and modern transformation In fact, both witches said, fictional depictions of witches are almost entirely inaccurate. As long as your intentions are clear and your mind is open, you can become a witch, Samayoa said. “I feel like everyone has magic within themselves,” she said. While Samayoa’s book includes spells intended to bring their casters money and abundance, some of the most essential spells she shares are for self-care and healing. It’s not easy to tell when those spells have worked, as there’s very rarely a simple fix for problems so nebulous. But once they’ve worked, a witch will know, she said. “Since the magic is coming from you and you alone, if you’re not feeling like you love yourself, your magic isn’t going to be as strong as you want it to be,” she said. “Taking care of yourself is better for your witchcraft.” Both witches said that practicing witchcraft is healing, even if the process remains unfinished. “Witchcraft is a transformative thing — it changes us,” Green said. “I believe we have to embrace every aspect of ourselves, the hardest parts, we have to love it. That’s our empowerment.”"
‘Proof of how hard I fought’: Why Olivia Munn chose to show her mastectomy scars in new Skims campaign,"Jacqui Palumbo,CNN","1:51 PM EDT, Thu October 24, 2024",3 minute,"Style,Fashion","Olivia Munn is the latest star to model for shapewear brand Skims, and in the campaign images the actor shows her mastectomy scars as she continues her fight against breast cancer. In the photographs, taken by artist Vanessa Beecroft, Munn models products by the Kim Kardashian-founded lingerie and shapewear brand, including a head-turning nipple illusion bra. Launched in the final week of Breast Cancer Awareness Month as a partnership with the Susan G. Komen organization, the campaign encourages women to pursue early screenings, according to a press release. Munn has advocated for people to calculate their breast cancer risk score, which helped lead to her diagnosis early last year. “This cause is deeply personal to me, and I’m proud to help drive awareness and conversation around it,” Munn said in the release. “SKIMS’ commitment to empowerment and community aligns perfectly with the message of this campaign, which is all about confidence, comfort, and feeling your best self. That’s exactly how I felt shooting this.” Last month, Munn shared a timeline of her breast cancer journey on social media, which has included multiple mammograms, ultrasounds and a genetic test in 2022 and early 2023. All of those screenings came back negative. But in March, her physician screened her using the Tyrer-Cuzick Risk Assessment Calculator and found Munn’s lifetime risk was 37.3%, more than triple the risk of the general population. This led her to pursue more testing including an MRI and biopsies. She was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer in April 2024, and has since undergone a double mastectomy and reconstruction along with other treatments. Related article

Crystal-covered underwear Munn also had surgery for a partial hysterectomy this past April, she noted, several months after undergoing egg retrieval. She and her husband, the comedian John Mulaney, welcomed their second child via a surrogate in September. In a podcast episode with the Susan G. Komen organization, Munn spoke more on the importance of her campaign with Skims. “When people think of SKIMS, they think of beauty and sexiness, and with breast cancer, I think that it’s not always the first thing that people think about, maybe like not even in the top hundred.” She revealed she had initially wanted to cover some of her scars for the project, but experienced a moment in between shots that changed her mind. “After my first shot with this one black bodysuit, we were changing and we were touching up my scars with my makeup artist. And then it just hit me after she touched up one scar that is placed in a way that I haven’t really learned to love yet,” she recalled. “But I was looking at my mastectomy scars and I was thinking about the first time I saw them and how shocking it was for me. And I thought, you know what? I do look at these scars as proof of how hard I fought. And I think I want to not only embrace the scars right now but show other women who have these same scars that there’s nothing to feel bad about.” Munn joins celebrities including Sabrina Carpenter, Megan Fox, Heidi Klum, Cardi B and Lana Del Ray, who have all modeled for Kardashian’s brand. Skims has a history of supporting social causes, and has previously made donations to families affected by COVID-19 as well as to Ukraine relief efforts. The brand also recently landed high-profile partnerships with the WNBA and NBA, and worked with Team USA at the summer Olympics in Paris. Through the end of the month, Skims says it will donate a portion of its bra sales to Susan G. Komen in support of breast cancer research and awareness."

The mysteries — and sometimes miracles — of the fertility fight,"say by Jessica Schneider,CNN","10:43 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",10 minute,,"It was the night before we would find out if our fifth – and likely final – try at an embryo transfer worked, and I sat on the couch with my husband, sobbing into a blanket. For the 10 days after having the embryo transferred to my uterus, I fluctuated between positivity and negativity; some days I was sure it had worked, but other days I acknowledged it probably hadn’t. That final night, I knew in my gut that we’d failed again. We’d thrown everything we had at this one: acupuncture, supplements and even a 24-hour trip to Chicago for platelet-rich plasma therapy in which doctors injected certain parts of my blood into my uterus in an effort to thicken its persistently thin lining. I took a pregnancy test the morning after my breakdown on the couch, and sure enough, it was negative. Doctors caution that at-home tests can be unreliable, and they urge fertility patients to wait for in-office blood tests that are more accurate. But I couldn’t wait. Months before, the news of my first failed embryo transfer had upended my workday, so I began taking my own tests as a way to protect myself from the inevitable devastation of a nurse’s 3 p.m. phone call in the midst of an unrelenting news cycle. I am a justice correspondent at CNN. I began fertility treatments just weeks before I was the first correspondent on our air to report that the US Supreme Court had overturned Roe v. Wade. My five embryo transfers over the next 18 months coincided with the upheaval surrounding that decision, plus the January 6 congressional hearings and former President Donald Trump’s numerous court fights. It was an insanely hectic time at work, but at the same time, I was riding the emotional rollercoaster of a fertility regimen that wasn’t working. I’m sharing my story to give hope to the many women out there who are struggling. While I was on my journey, it helped me to hear stories of how other women dealt with the pain and how they persevered. I realize my battle was relatively short compared with others’, but I write this to give people hope that miracles do happen. I thought I had done everything right. Years before, at 36 years old, I began exploring my egg-freezing options, something a good friend had done at age 37 and had encouraged me to do as well. Marriage was not even remotely on my radar at the time, nor was any thought of immediately wanting or having kids. My journalism career was my focus. But, I thought, maybe my older self would thank me. So a few months after turning 37, I went through two rounds of egg retrieval, netting and freezing 23 eggs in all. Just before my first retrieval, I began dating the man I would marry. Freezing my eggs gave me peace of mind: I knew I’d probably want kids someday, but I was so consumed with living my life, chasing my dreams and now dating an incredible man that settling down and having kids was, even in my late 30s, not at the front of my mind. Adam and I got married in May 2019, just weeks after I turned 39, and we got pregnant on our honeymoon. Yes, it was the dream scenario. And I was completely naïve. I knew I was lucky to get pregnant so easily, but I didn’t realize how many women struggle. In fact, I’ve since apologized to my sister about my ignorance and insensitivity. The two of us got pregnant at the exact same time, and we now have sons who are just five days apart in age. But her first pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage, and she struggled for more than a year to get pregnant with her first child. Though we shared a pregnancy timeline, I wasn’t sensitive enough to the fact that she was so nervous while I felt relatively carefree. The birth of my son Lincoln was very difficult. I was induced at 39 weeks, and after four hours of pushing and three attempts to extract my son via vacuum, we proceeded to an emergency C-section. I was disappointed but also exhausted and ready to take any steps necessary to ensure the safe delivery of my son. I was elated to hold him in my arms, but in the weeks after the birth, I was still bleeding heavily and occasionally passed large clots. During my six-week postpartum checkup, doctors performed an ultrasound and discovered that I was experiencing the effects of retained placenta. Days later, I underwent a dilation and curettage, also known as D&C, a surgical procedure that removes tissue from inside the uterus. After that, I felt fine – or maybe I was just distracted, caring for an extremely colicky newborn – and I thought all was back to normal. But 18 months later, when we began trying for a second child, I realized nothing was normal. I was 41 years old and 100% sure I wanted a sibling for my son. Sometimes, it felt like that desire was greedy: We had one healthy child, some remarked, so why couldn’t we just be happy with that? But I wasn’t. I remember the pain and sadness I felt when picking up my son from day care and feeling like every other mom there was pregnant with a sibling for their child. In fact, so many moms were expecting that the kids became accustomed to pregnant bellies. At one pickup, a group of kids ran up to me, put their hands on my belly and asked: “Is there a baby in there?” I laughed it off, but inside, I was distraught. When we weren’t conceiving naturally, I thought to myself: No problem, that’s why I froze my eggs. We began the process to turn those eggs into embryos in March 2022 and soon were elated to learn that my 23 eggs had resulted in 10 healthy and viable embryos. We were convinced that we were on easy street and would be pregnant again in no time. But while I was undergoing the extensive hormone regimen for our first planned embryo transfer, the doctors discovered that my uterine lining was not improving to the thickness necessary to support a pregnancy. Our June 2022 transfer was cancelled, and I was devastated. It began to feel like time was just slipping away. I was now 42, my son was almost 2½, and I was wondering if a second child was really in the cards for us. Then another transfer was cancelled, and by late summer 2022, doctors decided to move forward despite my extremely thin uterine lining. A first transfer failed, as did the second. Just before the third transfer, my doctor told me that my best chance at a live birth would be through gestational carrier, when another woman works with you to carry the embryo that is biologically yours. I was speechless. That was not the solution I was expecting to hear, especially on the eve of yet another embryo transfer. To have my doctor seem to give up hope without much explanation enraged me. Sure enough, the third transfer failed. I frantically began consulting other doctors and other fertility clinics about what might be wrong with me. I decided the easiest and most immediate path forward would be to switch doctors at the same clinic. I was lucky to have Dr. Michael Levy, founder of Shady Grove Fertility, agree to work with me. His positive outlook and determination to discover what was going wrong was exactly what I needed in that moment. He brought me in for additional ultrasounds and another hysteroscopy, and he tried different hormone regimens — all as we moved toward another embryo transfer. In those ensuing months, Dr. Levy concluded that my persistently thin uterine lining was probably a result of my postpartum D&C — something I had long suspected but no doctor had been forthcoming about. I’ll never forget when he showed me a picture of the inside of my uterus, taken during a hysteroscopy. It showed a sheet-white interior, not the fluffy pink that should be apparent in the lining. Dr. Levy suggested increasing my estrogen dosage before the transfers to boost the thickness of the uterine lining. Four months later, and before we underwent a fourth embryo transfer, we found out we were pregnant naturally. It was baffling and exciting. But a slow heartbeat was detected at the six-week ultrasound, and we ultimately lost the pregnancy at eight weeks, when another ultrasound no longer detected a heartbeat. We were devastated again, but that miscarriage gave me hope: Maybe my body could support a pregnancy. Still, my miscarriage lasted eight weeks. Even though I had a D&C, some of the pregnancy tissue remained, and yet another procedure was needed to remove it. The procedures and doctor visits felt endless, but with new hope, we barreled forward to a fourth embryo transfer, despite my thin lining. After another transfer, we got word that it failed and felt despair again. Several months later, in January 2024, we did one last embryo transfer, knowing that there was no point in continuing to spend the money if that fifth didn’t work. I remember sitting on the bed with my husband just hours before we officially found out about our fifth failure, both of us in agony that we couldn’t make it work despite what felt like endless efforts. In early 2024, our despair turned into determination. We still had five embryos remaining, and we began exploring the possibility of a gestational carrier — yes, the same path my first doctor had suggested more than a year prior, at which I had balked. I began seeking out women who also had difficulty. Kristen Welker of NBC News and Rebecca Jarvis of ABC News were tremendous sources of support and inspiration as we tried to decide whether surrogacy was the right path for us. We interviewed surrogacy agencies and began filling out applications. We were determined to give our son a sibling, no matter the path. We were so fortunate that we had so many healthy embryos still remaining. My husband was a true rock throughout these years of devastation and despair. Sure, there were late nights in the kitchen when our frustrations resulted in screaming matches. We often wondered whether we should just accept that we would have only one child. But when surrogacy seemed like our only option, we both agreed that we might later regret not taking that route. Even with the staggering $100,000-plus price tag, we talked about taking out loans and cutting costs, hoping that one day, the price we paid would be small compared with the joy of being a family of four. In late March 2024, the impossible happened. On Easter Sunday, days away from turning 44, I discovered I was pregnant – naturally. The next day, in another twist of fate, the surrogacy agency notified us that they had found us a match. It was hard to get too excited about the pregnancy after all our failures and disappointments. The prospective surrogate agreed to wait a few weeks, until we knew how the pregnancy was progressing. Incredibly, the baby looked strong from the first heartbeat at six weeks and again at an eight-week ultrasound. I held my breath through the first and second trimesters, only starting to somewhat relax once we hit 30 weeks. Now, we are just weeks away from welcoming our second son, although fear sometimes creeps in that something could still go wrong. I still wonder how and why any of this happened. I realize how fortunate I am. It is a true miracle that I got pregnant naturally after years of struggling. I also realize that so many women are not as lucky. My message to women out there is to hold on to hope. It took three years until we got our miracle. For others, it takes much longer. And for some, it’s a different path entirely. Even though I ultimately didn’t get pregnant as a result of freezing my eggs at age 37, that decision gave me hope and provided us with options. I recommend it to any woman who thinks they may want children at some point. Advocate for yourself. If you aren’t getting the answers you deserve from one doctor, switch to another. Speak up when something doesn’t feel right. And talk to other women about their struggles. Several friends told me about their miracle pregnancies in their mid-40s, and it helped me immensely to hear them. It was all of these shared stories of hope that kept me going. The fertility journey can be emotionally draining and physically difficult. Although we live in a society where the struggle has often become more difficult after Roe v. Wade was overturned, it is also a society where women have become more transparent and open to discussing their struggles. Ask questions, seek out women who have gone through difficulty, and never give up on your determination or hope."
Stunning fossil trapped in amber reveals previously unknown species that lived during the time of dinosaurs,"Taylor Nicioli,CNN","5:26 PM EDT, Fri October 25, 2024",4 minute,"Science,Unearthed","Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. When dinosaurs roamed Earth, their surroundings looked very different than the world of today. But there were also some similarities. And now scientists have confirmed a new one: Diverse firefly species lit up the night during the late Mesozoic. The discovery comes from a fossil of an ancient firefly species that was initially discovered in 2016, trapped in 99 million-year-old Burmese amber from northern Myanmar. The beetle is only the second firefly species from the Mesozoic to be identified. Scientists estimated that fireflies evolved aerial bioluminescence, the ability to glow during flight, at least 100 million years ago in a July 2022 study that analyzed the first Mesozoic firefly fossil that was described in 2015. But because firefly remains from this period can be difficult to come by since the insects’ softer bodies don’t preserve well in the fossil record, the evolution of the beetles and their bioluminescence has been difficult to pinpoint, experts say.

      World’s largest arthropod lived 300 million years ago. Now, fossils show what it really looked like The recently identified species, dubbed Flammarionella hehaikuni, could help researchers better understand the early evolution of fireflies and this characteristic trait, according to a study published September 11 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. “The fossil helps bridge gaps in understanding the evolutionary history of the lampyroid beetles (the beetle family fireflies belong to) and shows that key traits, like abdominal light organs, have remained consistent since the mid-Cretaceous,” said lead study author Chenyang Cai, professor at Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in an email. “How cool is it that dinosaurs once saw fireflies flying at dusk?” Upon first look of the firefly fossil in 2016, Cai said he thought the insect was a type of beetle in the Elateroidea family — similar to a separate species Cai also helped to identify from Burmese amber in 2021 — due to the fossilized insect’s unique serrate antennae that modern fireflies do not have. But when he revisited the peculiar fossil described in the new study in late 2022, Cai noticed the well-preserved light organ, a characteristic of fireflies. There are 10 past firefly species that are only known from fossils, said Dr. Oliver Keller, a research museum collection specialist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who has studied the systematics and taxonomy of fireflies. “The significance of this discovery is in the rarity of fossils of fireflies from that period,” Keller said via email. Because only one other Cretaceous firefly species has been identified, “this new species can be used to revisit the (July 2022 study) to better date the evolution of fireflies given the new evidence,” he added. Keller was not part of the new study or the 2022 research. Related article
      Woolly rhino found preserved in Russian permafrost after 32,000 years Fireflies glow for a multitude of reasons, most commonly as a defense mechanism and a way to communicate and attract mates. While it is hard to speculate how the flashes would have looked 100 million years ago, it is possible they would have looked similar to those seen today, Keller said. The study authors named the beetle as a homage to French astronomer Camille Flammarion and Haikun He, an amateur collector who had donated several other amber specimens to the authors, according to the study. There are more than 2,000 firefly species found today, according to the Natural History Museum in London. The study authors hypothesize that the newly reported ancient firefly species belonged to the Luciolinae, a subfamily that currently includes about 450 species, due to the placement of the light organ on the insect’s abdomen, said study coauthor Dr. Robin Kundrata, an entomologist and an associate professor in the department of zoology at the Palacký University Olomouc in the Czech Republic. However, no existing Luciolinae species sports the peculiar antennae that the fossil had, which the authors suspect would also differ depending on the sex of the insect, according to the study. The newly identified fossil is that of a female. Related article
      Fossils reveal that some pterosaurs soared like vultures, while others flapped their wings What’s more, the firefly fossil, which measures less than 1 centimeter (0.4 inch) long, is morphologically different from the other specimen identified in 2015, showing that the light organs of Mesozoic species were more diverse than once thought but still similar to ones in modern fireflies, Kundrata said in an email. The authors said they hope more firefly fossils from the Mesozoic will come to light to further scientists’ understanding of the mysterious origins of the bioluminescent beetles. “Based on the recent knowledge, fireflies originated in the Mesozoic Era although the more precise period of their origin remains unclear. … Future discoveries may reveal further information on their diversity and morphology,” Kundrata said. “Since there is no information about the immature stages of fireflies from their early evolution, we would be happy for discoveries of fossil larval specimens from Mesozoic.” Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified a species Cai identified in 2021."
Lost Silk Road cities mapped using remote sensing,"Katie Hunt,CNN","11:16 PM EDT, Wed October 23, 2024",5 minute,"Science,Unearthed,Archaeology","Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Lost for centuries, two cities lay buried, nearly 5 kilometers (3 miles) apart, underneath grassy pastures in the mountains of Uzbekistan. Now, archaeologists for the first time have mapped these intriguing highland strongholds in the country’s southeast — once a key crossroad of ancient silk trade routes — that were inexplicably abandoned. Using drone-borne LiDAR — light detection and ranging equipment — that can find structures obscured by vegetation, researchers captured images revealing two unexpectedly large-scale urban settlements dotted with watchtowers, fortresses, complex buildings, plazas and pathways that tens of thousands of people may have called home. Uncovering what would have been bustling medieval cities at a dizzying elevation of more than 2,000 meters (6,562 feet) above sea level was surprising, said anthropologist Michael Frachetti, lead author of the new research published Wednesday in the journal Nature. Life in the two settlements would have been tough, particularly during the winter months. “This is the land of nomads, the land of pastoralists. It’s a periphery as far as most people are concerned,” said Frachetti, a professor of archaeology at the Spatial Analysis, Interpretation and Exploration laboratory at Washington University in St. Louis. Today, only 3% of the planet’s population lives at or above such great heights, mainly on the Tibetan Plateau and in the Andes, according to the study. Ancient highland settlements, such as Machu Picchu in Peru, are considered anomalies given the harshness of life at high elevations, the study noted. “It’s a really different environment up there,” Frachetti said of the newly discovered Silk Road settlements. “It’s winter there already. It’s freezing cold. We get snow in summer.” The archaeological team has kicked off preliminary excavations at the two sites to unravel who exactly established the enigmatic lost cities — and why. Central Asia’s mountains and steppes have been home to powerful nomadic groups for thousands of years. These nomads on horseback built empires, centering their lives around herding animals such as sheep, goats and cattle since the Bronze Age. However, the newfound highland cities were too big to simply be trading posts or Silk Road stopovers, Frachetti and his colleagues believe. More likely, they reasoned in the study, the urban settlements were built to exploit abundant iron ore found underground in the region. The team hopes excavations will reveal who founded and lived in the cities. “The entire region is sitting on a highly prized commodity of the time, which is iron, and it’s also dense in juniper forest, which would have provided fuel (for smelting),” Frachetti said. While the region isn’t suitable for agriculture, he thinks the surrounding land would have sustained the cities’ inhabitants by supporting grazing herds as part of the pastoral lifestyle that had long existed there. Moreover, the mountain terrain would have also offered an effective defensive position. Along with his Uzbek colleague and study coauthor Farhod Maksudov, a researcher and director at the National Center of Archeology at the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Frachetti first came across one of the settlements in 2011 while conducting an archaeological survey of the region. “Our goal at that time was really to study the prehistory of these mountain regions as it relates to the development of nomadic pastoralism,” he said. “In the process of that work, we stumbled upon the smaller of the two cities, Tashbulak, and it was quite a sensation to find a highland city,” he said. Frachetti and his colleagues found the second and larger of the two cities, Tugunbulak, in 2015 after a local forestry worker mentioned similar shapes to those in Tashbulak in the landscape where he lived. “We got down there and right in his backyard is a medieval citadel. He just didn’t know it.We go up to the mound and we look out, and we can see mounds and pyramidical (shapes) all over the place, and we’re like, oh my gosh, this place is huge.” The team mapped the two cities in 2022, making 22 flights with a drone equipped with LiDAR. The endeavor marked the first time researchers have used the technology in the region, according to the study. A LiDAR sensor tracks the amount of time each laser pulse takes to return and uses that information to create a three-dimensional map of the environment below. The technique has revolutionized the study of human history and culture and been particularly useful in discovering archaeological sites in the Amazon rainforest and Maya sites in Central America. During the heyday of the medieval Silk Roads, cities emerged and other flourished, said Zachary Silvia, a postdoctoral research associate at the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World at Brown University in Rhode Island. But better known towns along the route such as Samarkand in Uzbekistan and Kashgar in China, were situated in vast agricultural oases. “High-altitude urban sites are extraordinarily rare in the archaeological record because of a unique set of landscape challenges and technological demands that must be overcome for people to form large communities in mountainous areas,” Silvia, who was not involved in the research, wrote in a commentary that was published alongside the research. “The discovery of Tashbulak and Tugunbulak forces us to reconsider notions about the optimal location for establishing a city.” The study, based on the LiDAR data, found that Tugunbulak occupied approximately 1.2 square kilometers (120 hectares) and showed evidence of more than 300 unique structures, which vary in size from 30 to 4,300 square meters (323 to 46,285 square feet). Tashbulak, meanwhile, covered 0.12 to 0.15 square kilometers (12 to 15 hectares) and while smaller, included a citadel made of an elevated mound surrounded by dense architecture and walled fortifications made from packed earth. The study team found at least 98 visible habitations, which shared a similar shape and size to those in Tugunbulak. The researchers believe Tashbulak was inhabited between the sixth and 11th centuries, while Tugunbulak was active from the eighth to 11th centuries, he said. It’s not clear why the settlements were abandoned. “Those stories will become clearer once we delve deeper into the archaeology,” Frachetti said. There is no sign that they were razed, burned or attacked, he added, but it’s a topic of active study."
A giant meteorite boiled the oceans 3.2 billion years ago. Scientists say it was a ‘fertilizer bomb’ for life,"Ashley Strickland,CNN","10:30 AM EDT, Tue October 22, 2024",7 minute,"Science,Unearthed,Paleontology","Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. A massive space rock, estimated to be the size of four Mount Everests, slammed into Earth more than 3 billion years ago — and the impact could have been unexpectedly beneficial for the earliest forms of life on our planet, according to new research. Typically, when a large space rock crashes into Earth, the impacts are associated with catastrophic devastation, as in the case of the demise of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, when a roughly 6.2-mile-wide (10-kilometer) asteroid crashed off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula in what’s now Mexico. But Earth was young and a very different place when the S2 meteorite, estimated to have 50 to 200 times more mass than the dinosaur extinction-triggering Chicxulub asteroid, collided with the planet 3.26 billion years ago, according to Nadja Drabon, assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Harvard University. She is also lead author of a new study describing the S2 impact and what followed in its aftermath that published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “No complex life had formed yet, and only single-celled life was present in the form of bacteria and archaea,” Drabon wrote in an email. “The oceans likely contained some life, but not as much as today in part due to a lack of nutrients. Some people even describe the Archean oceans as ‘biological deserts.’ The Archean Earth was a water world with few islands sticking out. It would have been a curious sight, as the oceans were probably green in color from iron-rich deep waters.” When the S2 meteorite hit, global chaos ensued — but the impact also stirred up ingredients that might have enriched bacterial life, Drabon said. The new findings could change the way scientists understand how Earth and its fledgling life responded to bombardment from space rocks not long after the planet formed. Early in Earth’s history, space rocks frequently hit the young planet. It is estimated that “giant impactors,” greater than 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) across, pummeled the planet at least every 15 million years, according to the study authors, meaning that at least 16 giant meteorites hit Earth during the Archean Eon, which lasted from 4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago. But the fallout of those impact events isn’t well understood. And given Earth’s ever-changing geology, in which massive craters are covered over by volcanic activity and the movement of tectonic plates, the evidence of what happened millions of years ago is hard to find. Drabon is an early-Earth geologist intrigued by understanding what the planet was like before the first continents formed and how violent meteoritic impacts affected the evolution of life. “These impacts must have significantly affected the origin and the evolution of life on Earth. But how exactly remains a mystery,” Drabon said. “In my research, I wanted to examine actual ‘hard’ evidence — excuse the pun — of how giant impacts affected early life.” Drabon and her colleagues conducted fieldwork to search for clues in the rocks of the Barberton Makhonjwa Mountains of South Africa. There, geological evidence of eight impact events, which occurred between 3.6 billion and 3.2 billion years ago, can be found in the rocks and traced through tiny meteorite impact particles called spherules. The small, round particles, which can be glassy or crystalline, occur when large meteorites hit Earth, and they form sedimentary layers in rocks that are known as spherule beds. The team collected a range of samples in South Africa and analyzed the rocks’ compositions and geochemistry. “Our days typically begin with a long hike into the mountains to reach our sampling locations,” Drabon said. “Sometimes we’re fortunate to have dirt roads that bring us closer. At the site, we study the structures in the rocks across the impact event layer in great detail and use sledgehammers to extract samples for later analysis in the lab.” The tightly sandwiched layers of rock preserved a mineral timeline that allowed the researchers to reconstruct what happened when the S2 meteorite hit. The S2 meteorite was between 23 and 36 miles (37 and 58 kilometers) in diameter as it struck the planet. The effects were swift and ferocious, Drabon said. “Picture yourself standing off the coast of Cape Cod, in a shelf of shallow water,” Drabon said. “It’s a low-energy environment, without strong currents. Then all of a sudden, you have a giant tsunami, sweeping by and ripping up the seafloor.” The tsunami swept across the globe, and heat from the impact was so intense that it boiled off the top layer of the ocean. When oceans boil and evaporate, they form salts such as those observed in the rocks directly after the impact, Drabon said. Dust injected into the atmosphere from the impact darkened the skies within hours, even on the opposite side of the planet. The atmosphere heated up, and the thick dust cloud prevented microbes from converting sunlight into energy. Any life on land or in shallow waters would have felt the adverse effects immediately, and those effects would have persisted from a few years to decades. Eventually, rain would have brought back the top layers of the ocean, and the dust settled. But the deep ocean environment was another story. The tsunami churned up elements such as iron and brought them to the surface. Meanwhile, erosion helped wash coastal debris into the sea and released phosphorus from the meteorite. The lab analysis showed a spike in the presence of single-celled organisms that feed off iron and phosphorus immediately after the impact. Life rapidly recovered, and then it thrived, Drabon said. “Before the impact, there was some, but not much, life in the oceans due to the lack of nutrients and electron donors such as iron in the shallow water,” she said. “The impact released essential nutrients, such as phosphorus, on a global scale. A student aptly called this impact a ‘fertilizer bomb.’ Overall, this is very good news for the evolution of early life on Earth, as impacts would have been much more frequent during the early stages of life’s evolution than they are today.” The S2 and Chicxulub asteroid impacts had different consequences due to the space rocks’ respective sizes and the stage the planet was in when each one struck, Drabon said. The Chicxulub impactor struck a carbonate platform on Earth, which released sulfur into the atmosphere. The emissions formed aerosols that caused a sharp, extreme drop in surface temperatures. And while both impacts caused significant die-offs, hardy, sunlight-dependent microorganisms in shallow waters would have rapidly recovered after the S2 impact once the oceans filled back in and the dust settled, Drabon said. “Life during the time of the S2 impact was much simpler,” she said. “Consider brushing your teeth in the morning: You might eliminate 99.9% of bacteria, but by evening, they have returned.” Ben Weiss, the Robert R. Shrock Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was intrigued by the geological observations of the spherule beds in the paper, which he believes are allowing researchers to explore Earth’s ancient impact record the way astronomers can study the surfaces of planets like Mars. Weiss was not involved in the study. “There are no impact craters preserved on the Earth today that come anywhere near in size to what has been inferred to have produced the rocks studied here,” Weiss said. “Of course, what is special about our record is that, however fragmental and incomplete, it is the only record we can currently study in detail that can tell us about the effects of impacts on the early evolution of life. It’s also impressive that despite the very local nature of these observations (outcrops in a small region in South Africa), we can start to understand something about the global nature of these giant impact events.” The rocks in the Barberton Makhonjwa Mountains are opening up a whole new line of research into Earth’s history of impacts for Drabon and her colleagues. “We aim to determine how common these environmental changes and biological responses were after other impact events in early Earth’s history,” she said. “Since the effect of each impact depends on various factors, we want to assess how frequently such positive and negative effects on life occurred.”"
"World’s largest arthropod lived 300 million years ago. Now, fossils show what it really looked like","Ashley Strickland,CNN","1:08 PM EDT, Fri October 18, 2024",6 minute,"Science,Unearthed,Paleontology","Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. For nearly two centuries, scientists have tried to solve an enduring mystery about a giant millipede-like animal named Arthropleura that used its many legs to roam Earth more than 300 million years ago. Now, two well-preserved fossils of the creature unearthed in France have finally revealed what Arthropleura’s head looked like, providing insights into how the giant arthropod lived. Today, arthropods are a group that includes insects, crustaceans, arachnids such as spiders, and their relatives — and the extinct Arthropleura remains the largest known arthropod ever to live on the planet. Scientists in Great Britain first found fossils of Arthropleura in 1854, with some adult specimens reaching 8.5 feet (2.6 meters) long. But none of the fossils included a head, which would help researchers determine key details about the creature, such as whether it was a predator similar to centipedes or an animal that merely fed off decaying organic material like millipedes. In a quest to find the first complete head, researchers conducted an analysis of Arthropleura fossils belonging to two juvenile individuals uncovered in the 1970s in France. The findings were published October 9 in the journal Science Advances. The odd tale of Arthropleura gained a new twist when the study team scanned the fossils, which are still trapped in stone. The head of each animal showcases characteristics belonging to both millipedes and centipedes, which suggests that the two types of arthropods are more closely related than previously believed, according to the study authors. “By combining the best available data from hundreds of genes from living species in this study, alongside the physical characteristics that allow us to place fossils like Arthropleura on evolutionary trees, we’ve managed to square this circle. Millipedes and centipedes are actually each other’s closest relative,” said study coauthor and paleontologist Dr. Greg Edgecombe, an expert in ancient invertebrates at London’s Natural History Museum, in a statement. From the fossils and treadlike tracks Arthropleura left behind, scientists determined that the massive creature lived between 290 million and 346 million years ago in what’s now North America and Europe — and it was just one of many giants roaming the planet. An abundance of atmospheric oxygen caused creatures such as scorpions and now-extinct dragonfly-like insects called griffinflies to reach enormous sizes that dwarf their modern counterparts, the study authors said. But Arthropleura still stood out, reaching about the same length as modern alligators, lead study author Mickaël Lhéritier said. Lhéritier is pursuing his doctorate in ancient myriapods, an arthropod group that includes millipedes and centipedes, at France’s Claude Bernard University Lyon 1 to understand how arthropods adapted to live on land millions of years ago. Once the animals died and became buried in layers of sediment over time, some of them became entombed in a mineral known as siderite, which solidified and formed a nodule around the remains. Becoming encased in stone helped preserve even the most delicate aspects of the fossilized creatures. Such nodules were first spotted at a coal mine in Montceau-les-Mines, France, in the 1970s and then were transferred to French museum collections. “Traditionally, we’d split open the nodules and take casts of the specimens,” Edgecombe said. “These days, we can investigate them with scans. We used a combination of microCT (micro-computed tomography) and synchrotron imagery to examine the Arthropleura inside, revealing the fine details of its anatomy.” The 3D scans revealed two nearly complete specimens of Arthropleura that lived 300 million years ago. Both fossilized animals still had most of their legs, and one of them had a complete head, including antennae, eyes, mandibles and its feeding apparatus — the first Arthropleura head ever documented, Lhéritier said. The team was surprised to uncover that Arthrorpleura had body characteristics seen in modern millipedes, such as two pairs of legs per body segments, as well as the head characteristics of early centipedes, such as the positioning of its mandibles and shape of its feeding apparatus. The creature also had stalked eyes, like crustaceans, Lhéritier said. In addition to helping researchers better understand what Arthropleura looked like, the discovery also draws a closer evolutionary connection between modern millipedes and centipedes. Previously, scientists thought the two arthropods had a more distant relationship, but in recent years, genetic studies have shown that millipedes and centipedes were more closely related. “This new scenario was (criticized) on the fact that there was no ‘fossil’ or anatomical argument to defend this grouping, but our new findings on Arthropleura that combine features of both groups tend to confirm this new scenario,” Lhéritier wrote in an email. Researchers believe the two Arthropleura fossils belonged to juveniles because they reach just 0.9 inch (25 millimeters) and 1.5 inches (40 millimeters) long. Studies of Arthropleura specimens have shown that the animals vary in the amount of body segments they have, similar to most millipedes that add body segments until they reach a fixed maximum. But centipedes have all their body segments already in place at birth, according to the study authors. Related article
      Ancient swimming ‘taco’ had ‘bug jaws,’ new fossils show This finding suggests that Arthropleura attained peak segmentation as an adult, rather than at birth. But the researchers are curious to determine whether they found true juvenile specimens, or a previously unknown smaller species, as well as the growth rate over time for such an animal. “Tracks found elsewhere in Montceau-les-Mines suggest that these Arthropleura were probably around 40 centimeters (1.3 feet) at their longest,” Edgecombe said. “While there’s nothing to say that they couldn’t be bigger, we don’t currently have any evidence of this.” Now that researchers have uncovered a complete Arthropleura head, they hope the discovery can help them solve other riddles about the giant animal, including what it ate and how it breathed. But other fossils that preserve additional aspects of the arthropod’s body, including the head of an adult, will need to be found. “While definite gut contents are yet to be found, other details of these fossils contribute to the debate over Arthropleura’s diet,” Edgecombe said. “They don’t have any venom fangs or legs (specialized) for catching prey, suggesting it probably wasn’t a predator. As its legs are better suited for slow movement, they were probably more like the detritus-eating millipedes alive today.” Lhéritier, who is studying another group of ancient myriapods that may have been amphibious, said he is curious about Arthropleura’s stalked eyes. “Today, stalked eyes are a typical feature of aquatic arthropods like crabs or shrimps,” he said. “Could it mean that Arthropleura could have been amphibious? To answer this, we need to find the respiratory system of Arthropleura. Finding these organs can help us (understand) the link of Arthropleura with water. Gills like crustaceans would mean an aquatic/amphibious lifestyle while tracheae (like insects or other myriapods) or lungs (like spiders) would mean a terrestrial lifestyle.” Related article

Lamsdell, associate professor of geology at West Virginia University in a related article that appeared in Science Advances. Lamsdell was not involved in the new study. “(These) remarkable findings, based on two almost complete juvenile individuals, present a new view of this enigmatic arthropod,” Lamsdell wrote. “(T)he most exciting discovery comes from the specimens’ heads that bear a mosaic of millipede and centipede characteristics. … As the mystery of the affinities of the largest known arthropod is laid to rest, the work of reconstructing the life history of this exceptional creature can finally begin.”"
Peer inside the underwater volcanic caves where life thrives,"Ashley Strickland,CNN","11:00 AM EDT, Sat October 19, 2024",4 minute,,"Editor’s note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. A mile and a half beneath the ocean’s surface, the seafloor seems nearly as alien as the surfaces of other planets. Deep-sea volcanic ridges, formed by the collisions of tectonic plates, create underwater hot springs in an otherwise frigid environment. These hydrothermal vents belch warm towers of elements that draw clusters of animal life, such as tube worms. Scientists have been intrigued by the vents, and the types of creatures that live around them, for half a century. There, animals develop symbiotic relationships with bacteria that use chemical reactions to produce sugars necessary for life beyond the reach of sunlight. Now, the study of deep-sea fauna has led to the discovery of an unexpected ecosystem where life thrives in the most unlikely of places. The arms of an underwater robot helped uncover communities of giant tube worms and snails living in volcanic caves beneath warm vents in the Pacific Ocean. “Animals are able to live beneath hydrothermal vents, and that, to me, is mind-blowing,” said Dr. Sabine Gollner, senior scientist at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research. Scientists uncovered the habitat during a 2023 expedition to the East Pacific Rise, a volcanically active ridge in the Pacific Ocean. Overturning small portions of Earth’s crust revealed tiny tube worm larvae as well as some tube worms that reached 1.6 feet (0.5 meter) long. The finding suggests unique ecosystems on the seafloor and within the subseafloor are connected, allowing life to thrive above and below the ocean bed. If you’ve ever longed for carbs, it may be an instinctual craving that could predate our existence as a species. New research has traced the evolution of a gene, called AMY1, that produces the enzyme amylase. It enables humans to break down starchy foods such as pasta, bread and potatoes for energy. The expansion of this gene likely began hundreds of thousands of years ago — well before the beginning of agriculture, and even before Neanderthals and Homo sapiens split, when ancient humans added certain carbohydrates to their prehistoric menu. SpaceX’s powerful Starship rocket lifted off from Boca Chica, Texas, on its fifth test flight last Sunday — and this time, the trial demonstrated the rapid recovery and reusability of its rocket boosters through an unprecedented feat of engineering. Stunning video showed a pair of massive metal pincers called “chopsticks” capturing the mega rocket booster in midair after it had broken away from the spacecraft. Separately, luxury fashion house Prada and commercial space company Axiom Space revealed the new design for the spacesuits the Artemis III astronauts will wear on the moon. And researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are developing a wearable robotic system called “SuperLimbs” to help astronauts recover from falls. In the moon’s partial gravity, it took NASA astronaut Charlie Duke three attempts to get up after falling on the moon in 1972 while he tested lunar soil. Scientists in 1854 first unearthed fossils of an alligator-size arthropod that lived 300 million years ago and resembled a giant millipede. But many mysteries about the creature called Arthropleura have endured, and it would take another 170 years before researchers found a specimen with a complete head. Scans of the well-preserved fossils, still trapped in stone, showed that Arthropleura had a body like a millipede, a head like a centipede and eyes like a crustacean. The discovery is not only changing how researchers understand the way that giant arthropods lived but also sheds light on the close evolutionary connections between centipedes and millipedes. Researchers strongly suspect that the subsurface ocean on Europa, one of Jupiter’s moons, is a potentially habitable environment for life, and now NASA’s Europa Clipper mission is on its way to investigate. The spacecraft lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Monday and will arrive in orbit around Jupiter and its intriguing moons in April 2030. The probe is NASA’s largest spacecraft built for a planetary mission, and it will conduct 49 flybys of Europa, eventually coming incredibly close to its surface. Instruments such as ice-penetrating radar will study the ocean below the moon’s thick ice shell, and a magnetometer will “sniff” particles released by plumes that rise up through cracks in the frozen surface to analyze the body of water’s composition. Zoom in on these mind-expanding stories: — Scientists detected microplastics in the breath of bottlenose dolphins living off the US Southeast coast for the first time, which suggests marine mammals are inhaling the potentially harmful particles. — Astronomers spotted a distant galaxy that’s surprisingly similar to the Milky Way, and it could change theories about how galaxies form and the universe evolved. — A robot designed by Yale University researchers moves like a caterpillar and can amputate its limbs and keep moving if trapped, much like a gecko can release its tail when grabbed by a predator. — Missed out on catching a glimpse of this week’s full hunter’s moon?

Europe’s secret season for travel starts now,"Terry Ward,CNN","2:03 PM EDT, Mon October 21, 2024",8 minute,,"Summer might be the most popular season for tourism to Europe, but it hardly promises a calm, cool and collected experience. Who can forget this summer’s protests against overtourism in Barcelona and Mallorca, the wildfires that raged across Greece during the country’s hottest June and July on record and selfie stoplights to help control crowds on the clogged streets of Rome and Florence? For travelers looking to avoid all that — as well as break less of a sweat literally and financially — welcome to Europe’s secret season. From roughly mid-October to mid-December, shoulder season for travel to Europe comes with fewer crowds, far more comfortable temperatures in places that skew scorching hot during the summer months and plunging prices on airfare and accommodation. “The cheapest time to fly to Europe is typically from about the middle point of October to the middle point of December,” said Hayley Berg, lead economist at travel platform Hopper. “Airfare prices during those eight or nine weeks or so will typically be about an average of 40% lower than prices in the peak of summer in June.” Hopper’s data shows that airfare to Europe from the United States during the period between October 20 and December 8 is averaging between $560 and $630 per ticket — down 9% from this time last year and 5% compared to the same timeframe in 2019. The data also shows that average nightly accommodation rates in the top 10 cities for travel in Europe (including places like Amsterdam, Paris and Munich) drop by 27% in December compared to June, when tourism is at its peak. For Americans not beholden to a family and turkey-centric holiday in the US, even Thanksgiving week can be considered shoulder season for European travel, said Katy Nastro, of travel site Going. “Because so many folks are focused on domestic travel due to the Thanksgiving holiday, domestic prices shoot upward,” she said. “But the upside to that is international travel, namely over to Europe, gets downright cheap due to airlines cutting fares in hopes to fill seats.” Related article
      Jus sanguinis – or ‘blood right’ – might entitle you to citizenship in Europe The in-between period starting the last week in November and into the first two weeks of December is another sweet spot for airfare from the US and accommodation deals in European destinations, Nastro said, citing this period as “the calm before the storm of winter holiday business.” She advised trying to travel before the week of December 16, when prices across the board begin to creep up. Jack Ezon, founder of EMBARK Beyond travel agency, said he’s seen a 22% shift recently from clients who traditionally traveled to Europe during the summer months now choosing to visit during the shoulder seasons of spring or fall instead. He attributes this trend to the fact that summers have become unbearably hot in many places, prices are roughly 40% to 50% higher in popular European destinations during the summer and the fact that overtourism has plagued so many places. Among the best spots Ezon points clients toward for autumn travel are Madrid, Barcelona and Ireland — where it’s not too hot or too cold in fall and you can avoid summer’s hordes of road trippers. Another great spot for fall? The principality of Monaco, bordering the French Riviera. “Though the beach clubs in St. Tropez are closed, Monaco is truly an all-year-round destination, with beautiful, mild weather well into December,” Ezon said, adding that the tiny country on the northern coast of the Mediterranean Sea offers shopping, great dining and access to stunning nature within close reach. Madeline Steuber, Virtuoso adviser and co-founder of Steuber Travel Group, said that being flexible with shoulder season travel can lead to the best prices on luxury accommodations as well as an all-around more fulfilling travel experience. “We encourage a lot of our clients who want to travel in what we call the festive period, which is later December, to consider moving their dates back to the week after Thanksgiving through the first two weeks of December,” she said. “We can get premium guides, premium drivers and excellent hotels at just lower price points for the same product than what they would pay for those in the summer,” she said. Steuber points to river cruising in Europe as a good fall option for covering a lot of ground with food and beverage expenditures included. The week after Thanksgiving through the first two weeks of December is the best time to get deals on river cruises, she said. And it’s a bonus that many river cruises along the Danube, Main and Rhine rivers visit Christmas markets at this time of year, too. “Any traveler who has wanted to take advantage of European Christmas markets but suffers from a lack of PTO may be in luck this year,” said Nastro. “Because Thanksgiving is the last week of November this year, you can squeeze in a winter holiday trip over the Thanksgiving week.” One of Germany’s famous Christmas markets opens on November 29 in Nuremberg, and France’s beloved Strasbourg Christmas market opens November 27, which means you could be sipping mulled wine and snacking on gingerbread while everyone back home is busy gobbling turkey and stuffing, she said. London, Paris and Rome remain the most searched European destinations for travel regardless of the time of year — including those end-of-year trips between mid-October and mid-December, said Berg. But more off-the-beaten path destinations in Europe that are showing an uptick in demand (including for searches at this time of year) include Marseille in Southern France, Cyprus, Denmark’s Faroe Islands, Longyearbyen in Norway’s Svalbard archipelago and Helsinki, according to Hopper data. All also offer lower prices on airfare from the US for end-of-year travel this year compared to the same periods last year and in 2019. Mediterranean cities in the south of France, Greece and Cyprus stay temperate into November and December and Northern European destinations including the Faroe Islands, Finland and Norway offer the chance to see the Northern Lights. “There’s definitely a trend among younger travelers toward many of these destinations,” said Berg. “Those domestic travelers from a few years ago who went to Jackson Hole are now headed to the Arctic Circle.” Booking.com’s recent reveal of 2025’s trending destinations also showed growing interest in unique cities in Europe such as Trieste, Italy; Tignes, France; and Villajoyosa, Spain. The site found that nearly two-thirds (61%) of Americans plan to travel in the off season in the coming year to lower the overall cost of their trips, according to Ben Harrell, managing director, US at Booking.com. Nastro said that while the Croatian coast and Kotor in Montenegro get packed with sun-seekers during the summertime, the shoulder season in these places offers a coziness that’s appealing, too. “Cultural festivals, homemade pumpkin seed oil, and gorgeous and almost tourist-free views should be considered,” she said. But she advises travelers to “stick to the bigger cities as some smaller seaside towns may be closed for the season.” And while Tuscany booms during the toasty summer months, November and December usher in crisp weather and white truffle season. Hotels like the 18th century Borgo San Vincenzo in Montepulciano can arrange truffle hunts and visits to local truffle markets, and a Christmas market even takes over the town’s Piazza Grande starting in mid-November. If you decide to break from the pack and head to Europe instead of a domestic destination, flying on Thanksgiving Day offers the added benefit of being the least crowded day at US airports during the holiday crush. And it’s best to avoid the jampacked Sunday after the holiday. Along with airfare, average nightly accommodation rates drop dramatically across Europe at the end of the year compared to during the peak summer months. Hopper’s data shows average nightly rates in cities like Paris and Reykjavik down 30% and more at the end of the year compared to peak summer. In Rome, the savings on nightly rates soars to 40% at the end of the year, with average room rates clocking in at $200 per night. That means a hotel you might have always dreamed of experiencing might suddenly be within reach. “Finding availability at certain European gems can be nearly impossible in the summer without early planning, but some of our favorite places still have availability for Thanksgiving,” said Fora adviser Kim Hannum. Among those luxury properties are Adare Manor in Limerick, Ireland; J.K. Place Roma in Italy; and Grand Hotel Son Net in Mallorca, Spain. An online search for rooms at Adare Manor shows rates of $814 for two people with breakfast on November 28, 2024, while a similar room on June 29, 2025, costs nearly double that at $1,524. At Mallorca’s Grand Hotel Son Net, a room on Thanksgiving night this year is 515 euros (around $560) while the same room on June 19, 2025 (when a two-night minimum is required due to peak season) costs 1,075 euros (around $1,168). And even if you can’t make a secret-season trip to Europe happen before the winter holidays are upon us, Berg said to mark your calendar and set price alerts for Travel Deal Tuesday — the travel equivalent of Black Friday. Those deals drop on December 3 this year. “The Tuesday after Thanksgiving is probably the single best day of the year to book a trip to Europe or anywhere international,” she said. “We see deep discounts on airfare deals and on hotel stays across the travel industry, and then obviously on the Hopper app as well.” Even though traveling to Europe in January or February is likely to bring even cooler temperatures, you can reap many of the same benefits of the fall lull, including lower prices and fewer crowds, she said. “There’s much more of a focus on tourism in summer,” Berg said. “Whereas during this period you’re having a much more local experience, which is what a lot of travelers are craving.” Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled the surname of travel adviser Kim Hannum. Florida-based travel writer Terry Ward lives in Tampa and is crossing fingers and toes for enough snow during an early-December ski trip to the Montana Lodge & Spa in Italy’s Aosta Valley."
He served with the US Army in Iraq. Now he’s one of Asia’s top chefs and a Netflix ‘Culinary Class Wars’ judge,"Alkira Reinfrank,CNN","1:13 AM EDT, Fri October 18, 2024",8 minute,"Travel,Food & Drink","From a warzone in Iraq to a Michelin-starred kitchen and a hit Netflix show, chef Sung Anh’s path to the top of Asia’s fine dining scene has been anything but ordinary. “Just like I did in the US Army, where I volunteered to go to the war, wanting to do something different — I decided to come here to Korea to try something different,” says the Korean-American chef and judge on hit reality cooking show “Culinary Class Wars,” which has just been green-lit for a second season. Sung, 42, is the head chef and owner of South Korea’s only three-Michelin-starred restaurant, Mosu Seoul. In recent weeks, he has gained a new legion of fans as the meticulous and straight-talking judge on the new Netflix series. It’s this passion and unwavering drive to forge his own path that’s helped reshape fine dining in his birth home. Related article
      How a female Buddhist monk became one of Asia’s most revered chefs Born in Seoul, South Korea’s capital, Sung and his family emigrated to San Diego, California when he was 13. “We were just a family from Korea, seeking the American Dream,” he says. “As an immigrant family, we didn’t really know English.” As a teen growing up on the US West Coast, his mind couldn’t have been further from cooking. “I went to school, got into college, but decided to join the US Army because that’s the only way I thought I could travel,” says the chef. Over four years of service, he trained in bases across the country, before being deployed to his country of birth, South Korea and — following 9/11 — to the Middle East. “When I volunteered to go to Iraq during the war, people asked me, ‘Why did you do such a crazy thing?’” he recounts. “I heard all these stories from my grandfather, my father, uncles and family friends about the Korean War and the Vietnam War. I volunteered to go to Iraq because… I thought I had this one chance to go to war and experience it.” In late 2002, he was deployed to Baghdad for a year-long tour as a specialist with an artillery unit, “clearing out bombs and weapons” from Iraqi forces, including the bunker where Saddam Hussein was found in 2003. Sung describes his time in the army as “eye-opening.” “Being a soldier for four years was one of the greatest times in my life, it’s one of the most exciting,” he says. “There were people from Dakota, Idaho, Puerto Rico, Hawaii. I learned about their cultures and subcultures within the country.” After his service, Sung wanted to shift gears — literally. A petrolhead who loved racing cars under the cover of darkness as a teenager, his dream was to become a mechanic for Porsche. But two weeks before he was set to begin his training, a chance encounter with a group of chefs outside the now-closed American branch of famed cooking school Le Cordon Bleu in California changed the course of his life again. “They were all in white shirts and checkered pants. I had no idea what the school was,” he recalls. After speaking with the chefs and a rather influential school counselor, Sung was “hooked” and decided to put his mechanic dreams on hold. “I didn’t ever look back, I never regretted it. And now I drive a Porsche, so it’s okay,” he says with a laugh. “I think it was very spontaneous for me to choose this profession,” he admits. However, cooking was always in his blood. As a child, Sung was raised on his grandmother’s food. And in the US, he got his first taste of being in the kitchen helping out at his family’s Chinese restaurant after school. After culinary school, he worked in some of the West Coast’s finest kitchens, from the Michelin-star draped French Laundry to Benu and Urasawa. “I’ve met some of the greatest chefs in the US. They’ve mentored me and I think they’ve refined the roughness that I had from the military,” he says, crediting them with teaching him about the importance of finesse in their profession. In 2015, Sung opened his own restaurant, Mosu San Francisco, combining American flavors with nods to his Korean heritage. It was a risk that paid off – within a year he was awarded his first Michelin star. “It didn’t satisfy me that much. I was very, very happy for my team, for myself. But I knew there’s more to do,” he says. “I wanted to come back to my country and utilize what I know and what I understand… use the indigenous ingredients, the Korean culture, the heritage.” So, after two decades in the US and a Michelin star to his name, it was time to bring Mosu home. In 2017, chef Sung opened Mosu Seoul in the heart of one of the world’s fastest-growing fine dining scenes. Here, his plan was simple: to innovate. Mosu was unlike anything Seoul had seen before. Sung took what he had created in San Francisco with fusion gastronomy and transformed the menu to celebrate Korean ingredients. But this was no ordinary Korean fare. The Korean-American chef prides himself on doing things differently — not being bound by one particular style of cooking or cuisine. He melds his culinary inspiration from his heritage and cross-culture upbringing, all with meticulous detail. The result? Thoughtful and playful courses, such as Mosu’s signature abalone taco, which features subtle nods to flavors from both his home and memories of California. “At Mosu, I cook what I think is the best, no boundaries, no genre,” he says. In 2022, Mosu Seoul was awarded three Michelin stars, and with it, the recognition of being the modern face of the South Korean capital’s transforming gastronomic scene. Sung’s meticulous attention to detail is on full display on Netflix’s hit reality cooking show “Culinary Class Wars,” where 20 elite chefs go head-to-head with 80 unknown cooks for the title of South Korea’s top chef. Chef Sung stars alongside veteran restaurateur Paik Jong-won as the much revered — and at times feared — judges on the show, demanding only the best from the incredible roster of chefs. The master technician known for his high standards – he makes even the top chefs sweat when tasting their dishes — admits he’s a little “uncomfortable” with his new-found fame. But Sung says he stayed true to himself on camera. “When I speak my mind, I speak accurately, logically and carefully, because they rely on what I say,” he says. “I wasn’t acting, I was just being me. I gave a lot of respect to the contestants for their courage. I know how difficult it is to make good food. I wanted to support them, but not everyone’s going to win. So I set my standards.” The show has put a spotlight on the growing strength and diversity of South Korean fine dining, which has been largely overlooked in global culinary circles until recently. “Korea’s fine dining and restaurant scene has grown so rapidly,” he says. “Seoul was once a layover city, now it is a destination.” In early 2024, four Seoul restaurants — including Mosu — made it to the list of Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants, including Mingles, Onjium and the fermentation specialist 7th Door. Chef Sung was also honored at this year’s Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants ceremony — the first time it was held in Seoul — for pioneering a new wave of Korean fusion cuisine with the Chefs’ Choice Award. The growth of Korean fine dining comes at a time when all eyes are on Korean chefs across the globe, from Komah in Sao Paulo to Atomix in New York. Two of the dozen Michelin stars awarded in New York in 2023 went to Korean restaurants. “Everyone around the world is fascinated by Korean culture, food, fine dining,” Sung says. “I think they’re really interested in what we’re doing, what the flavor profile is and how we represent this culture through food.” And for Sung, that means sharing his food with the world, too. In 2022, the chef opened a sister restaurant, Mosu Hong Kong, in contemporary art gallery M+ in the city’s burgeoning cultural district. As recognition grows for South Korean food, chef Sung takes things further at Mosu Seoul, celebrating more than just local ingredients. For instance, all the plates and bowls used at his restaurant are made by Korean artisans. “I wanted to put my food on a plate that matches my food, not just something that’s really beautiful, expensive or shiny,” he says. Sung sources all of Mosu’s tableware from specialist craft store Sikijang, in Seoul’s upscale Gangnam district. “I’ve worked with a lot of chefs, but chef Sung is different, he is quite special,” says Sikijang owner and creative director Chung So-yeong.

      Makgeolli: How Korean rice wine is stepping out of soju’s shadow “He can read different artists’ techniques and materials in crafts — it’s very impressive.” One of Mosu Seoul’s signature serving dishes — a pristine white porcelain plate — is made by a Seoul-based artist renowned for his elaborate and twisted porcelain sculptures. Ceramicist Yoon Sol had never made tableware until he was introduced to the chef in 2017. He was quickly inspired by chef Sung’s vision. “There are people who share the same thoughts, feelings and emotions as yourself, and you get goosebumps when you meet them,” says Yoon from his studio in the outskirts of Seoul. “Chef Sung gives life and character to each dish I make, which I find very respectable. I really think highly of his mindset and how he values beauty.” The pristine white of the ceramicist’s tableware makes chef Sung’s culinary creations pop. “I have a really good relationship with the artist,” Sung says. “I try to kind of put their intention and their work into the food and then show it off as one.” In early 2024, Mosu Seoul closed the doors on its original Itaewon location after seven years - relocating to a new home within the same district. The new-look Mosu is set to open in early 2025. As the new location undergoes its “Mosu” fit-out, the team has been busy developing the menu and hosting events across Asia. Chef Sung says the new space will “retain the DNA” of the original Mosu Seoul. But he plans to “bring it up a notch,” adding new dishes and a new look to the décor, ensuring Mosu Seoul continues to evolve and grow, just like South Korea’s fine dining scene."
The Full English: How a greasy feast came to define and divide a nation,"Will Noble,CNN","9:29 AM EDT, Tue October 15, 2024",9 minute,"Travel,Food & Drink","Picture something extremely British. Now double it. Did you imagine the Beatles, striding across Abbey Road — the twist being that their classic album cover is rendered in the contents of a full English breakfast? In 2012, food artist Paul Baker cooked up this exact scene. John is the (scrambled) eggman, while vegetarian Paul is tastefully made out of mushrooms. Abbey Road is re-surfaced in baked beans, a bacon Volkswagen Beetle pulled up on the side. Slabs of white and brown toast form the marked crosswalk. In one fell swoop of edible absurdism, Baker’s artwork demonstrates the cultural heft of the full English breakfast. Devoured in the nation’s “greasy spoon” cafes and motorway stop-offs — not to mention some of its ritziest hotels and restaurants — this gut-busting symphony of bacon, eggs, sausage and various other cooked ingredients (invariably sluiced down with a steaming cup of tea or coffee) has become shorthand for Britishness. It is as big as the Beatles, bigger. Like “Abbey Road” itself, the full English — or “fry-up” or “full monty” or “cooked breakfast” — is both revered as a thing of godlike genius, and has its sour-faced critics; those who claim it is too chaotic, too self-indulgent for its own good. So where did the full English originate? How did it come to define a nation? And come to think of it, what exactly is it? Historically, English breakfasts were a modest affair. For Britain’s Roman invaders, it was the least important meal of the day. Its medieval Norman conquerors were happy starting the morning with a hunk of bread and a slurp of weak ale. It’s true that meat was sometimes eaten first thing (in 1662, diarist Samuel Pepys recorded “a breakfast of cold roast beef”) but the genesis of the fry-up wasn’t really sparked until the Victorians came along. As Kaori O’Connor writes in “The English Breakfast,” “Large breakfasts do not figure in English life or cookbooks until the nineteenth century, when they appear with dramatic suddenness.” It was in the grand houses on country estates that these languorous, buffet-style breakfasts made their debut — the kind depicted in shows like the Edwardian-era “Downton Abbey”, where diners help themselves to hot viands piled high in silver chafing dishes. Aristocratic socialite and writer Lady Cynthia Asquith recalled breakfasts with “crisp, curly bacon, eggs (poached, boiled and fried), mounds of damp kedgeree (made with salmon), haddocks swimming in melted butter, sputtering sausages and ruddily exuding kidneys.” As well as being an indulgent display of wealth, writes O’Connor, the English breakfast was a robustly patriotic retort to the hors d’oeuvres-loving French: “There were no such things as a French breakfast… So breakfast time became the bastion of Englishness, and breakfast emerged as the national meal.” The middle classes soon cottoned on, encouraged by celebrity cook and domestic goddess Isabella Beeton. In 1861 Beeton published her “Book of Household Management,” which featured recipes for breakfast dishes including “fried ham and eggs” and “broiled rashers of bacon.” A trend soon emerged in the publishing world: “The Breakfast Book” (1865), “Handbook for the Breakfast Table” (1873), “Breakfast and Luncheon at Home” (1880), “Breakfast Dishes for Every Morning of Three Months” (1884). In 1874, the Edinburgh Evening News wrote of “An English Farmer’s Breakfast,” consisting of rashers of bacon “bubbling with grease and laid on thick slices of bread.” Other publications from the time carried ads for bacon and sausages. “For first-class breakfast bacon,” ran an ad in The Blyth Times in 1890, “try Thompson’s English rolled flitch.” By 1921, a Lady Jekyll was telling readers of The London Times that “no breakfast table is complete without eggs and bacon.” It’s easier said than done to spell out what a full English is. While various components (fish, marmalade, kidneys) gradually fell by the wayside, others were tacked on. Heinz beans — canned haricot beans in tomato sauce considered by many now to be an integral element of the fry-up — arrived in 1886, when the young entrepreneur Henry Heinz sold five cases to London department store Fortnum & Mason: “I think, Mr Heinz, we’ll take the lot!” HP Sauce — a spicy brown ooze, its bottle emblazoned with the Houses of Parliament — registered its name in 1895, and has smothered sausages the length and breadth of the country ever since. The many nuances of the full English are best appreciated by gazing into the window of any given greasy spoon, where you’ll be greeted with variations along the lines of: “Set 1: Egg, Bacon, Beans, Sausage, 2 Toast, Tea or Coffee “Set 2: Egg, Tomato, Sausage, Mushroom, 2 Toast, Tea or Coffee “Set 3: Egg, Bacon, Tomato, Sausage, Mushroom, Toast, Chips, Tea or Coffee…” On and on it goes, like the workings of some brainiac trying to break a calorific Enigma code. The mapping of a fry-up becomes all the more convoluted when you take into account its Celtic cousins, the full Scottish (with the addition of haggis, and traditional sausages switched out for square Lorne sausage); the full Irish or Ulster fry (often featuring soda bread and white, rather than black, pudding); and the full Welsh (where leftfield laverbread and fresh cockles get a place at the table). Even more confusingly, despite being called a fry-up, these days the ingredients are not necessarily fried. At least some aspects of the breakfast are easier to pigeonhole. Sausage, bacon and egg are usually a given, as is some form of bread with which to mop up the residue. Black pudding (aka blood pudding, a favorite of the late Anthony Bourdain), mushrooms, tomatoes (fresh or tinned) and chips regularly feature, but tend to be the diner’s choice. Every Brit has their own dream team of ingredients, their own thoughts on each ingredient realizing its full potential. Eggs might be fried, poached or scrambled. Bacon smoked or unsmoked. Bread could be fried, toasted, or left as is. A dollop of tomato ketchup or brown sauce may or may not adorn the side of the plate. In the sitcom “I’m Alan Partridge,” the eponymous local radio host provides a pompous postmortem on his Ukrainian girlfriend’s stab at a cooked breakfast: “Bacon, 10 on 10. Button mushrooms, bingo. Black pudding, snap. Minor criticism — more distance between the eggs and the beans. I may want to mix them but I want that to be my decision. Use the sausage as a breakwater. But I’m nitpicking. On the whole a very good effort. Seven on 10. Let’s make love.” Some ingredients should be disqualified altogether, argues Guise Bule from the English Breakfast Society, a group of volunteers who celebrate the history and tradition of the English breakfast. “Reconstituted potato hash browns are a lazy replacement for bubble and squeak,” he announces, with the air of scientific fact. Onion rings are another component that have elbowed their way onto British breakfast plates in recent times, in a move that many traditionalists consider sacrilege. One thing most fry-up lovers can agree on is that the breakfast should be heavy on the stomach, light on the wallet; something “Kitchen Nightmares” chef Gordon Ramsay is now painfully aware of since diners chided him for charging £19, or nearly $25, for what they perceived to be a particularly stingy spread. Such accusations cannot be leveled at the Dalby Cafe in Margate, Kent, which went viral after local rock star Pete Doherty demolished its infamous “mega breakfast” in under 20 minutes, earning himself a place on the coveted wall of fame. And you thought biting the head off a bat was rock ‘n’ roll. Like most English inventions — the flush toilet, the iron bridge, the hovercraft — the fry-up has not always enjoyed an easy ride. World War II brought severe food rationing, a broadside that took the fry-up years to recover from. Nonetheless, as mass-processed foods like sausages, battery-farmed eggs and sliced bread rocketed in the 1950s, the English breakfast became a national obsession. Any cafe or hotel worth its salt cooked one. Brits visiting the Spanish package vacation resorts of Benidorm and Majorca demanded eggs and bacon served beachside. In 1953, when thieves broke into a west London secondary school, they made time to fry themselves a few eggs and brew a pot of tea. But in today’s age of kale smoothies and overnight oats, the iconic breakfast faces a fresh reckoning. “To eat well in England,” the playwright Somerset Maugham once said, “you should eat breakfast three times a day.” Yet recent research shows younger Britons are eating just two or three fry-ups a year. In an acutely health (and time) conscious society, some are beginning to ask if the full English is dying out. If that is the case then British society is making a good job of hiding it. TV broadcasts constant reruns of “Four in a Bed,” a low-budget reality show in which bed-and-breakfast owners judge each other on the freshness of their duvets and the standard of their English breakfasts. Seaside resorts hawk miniature English breakfasts in hard candy form. On most high streets in the country you’ll find a branch of low-cost pub chain Wetherspoon slinging bacon, sausage and egg for as little as £2.99 a pop. At the other end of the restaurant spectrum, where Gordon Ramsay flubbed his lines, others have got the memo. The Hawksmoor restaurant chain recently reinstated its redoutable take on an English breakfast following public outcry when it was briefly paused. “We’ve never been so inundated by requests to bring something back,” explains Huw Gott, one of Hawksmoor’s co-founders. Every Saturday, Hawksmoor branches in London, Edinburgh and Liverpool pile up 50-80 plates with sugar-pit bacon chop, Victorian-style sausages, Moira black pudding, hash browns, grilled bone marrow, trotter baked beans, fried eggs, grilled mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, unlimited toast, and HP Sauce gravy. “Warning,” runs the breakfast’s tagline, “Not for the faint-hearted.” Far from simply being a ritzy take on Dalby Cafe’s angina-inducing food challenge, Hawkmoor’s breakfast is a paean to the early days of the hearty English breakfast. “We use a recipe from the Victoria era for our sausages made with pork, beef and mutton with plenty of herbs and spices,” says Gott. Elsewhere, the English breakfast continues to evolve, just as it always has. In April 2024, home appliance manufacturer Breville opened a “Grease-Less Spoon” pop-up, showing how ingredients could be cooked more healthily in an air fryer. Veggie and vegan options now appear on many breakfast menus. A brand established by Paul McCartney’s late wife, Linda, does a roaring trade in meat-free sausages, many of them ending up at the breakfast table. Something else hints at the fry-up’s immortality; who’s ordering it. “We have people from all over the world coming along hunting out a perfect British breakfast,” says Hawksmoor’s Huw Gott. Social media has ratcheted up this appreciation a notch or two. On TikTok, Francophile twists are attempted on this most British of breakfasts. American food presenter Adam Richman of “Man Vs Food” fame recently traveled to Bury Market in the north of England to savor lumps of Chadwick’s famed black pudding. The English breakfast was created as a statement piece, and in many ways it remains just that. A meaty calling card for Brits. A delicious tourist attraction. Something for foreigners to gawk at, sometimes bungle horrendously when they have a go at it themselves — but ultimately, relish and applaud. So long as there’s tourism in Britain, you can be sure the fry-up will follow. Just as, while there are Brits vacationing in Benidorm, the scent of sizzling bacon will continue to waft along the esplanade."
‘I want to be here for the rest of my life’: Why this man swapped San Francisco for Colombia,"Tamara Hardingham-Gill,CNN","9:33 AM EDT, Wed October 16, 2024",10 minute,,"After spending several years building a life he loved in San Francisco, Jason Bennett, originally from the Bay Area, had every intention of remaining in the Californian city for good. The senior marketing executive, who previously worked for Gap Inc., says his main goal was “to continue climbing the corporate ladder” and he couldn’t really envision being anywhere else. But in 2018, Bennett packed up and moved to the South American country of Colombia permanently after “falling hard” for Medellín, once one of the most notorious cities in the world. He now works for himself, running two companies, from his “adopted home.” “Life surprises you,” Bennett tells CNN Travel. So how did he end up ditching the US and moving to a destination he hadn’t even visited until two years earlier? Bennett, who first moved to San Francisco in 2006, explains that he had begun to feel disconnected from his job, as well as the city, and questioned whether he really wanted to spend the rest of his life “in an office working for other people.” “I wouldn’t quite call it an existential crisis, if you will, but I was getting a lot less fulfillment out of what was in my bank account,” he says. “And I was getting very frustrated with San Francisco, and these things were not adding up anymore.” After almost a decade in the city, Bennett, who says he’d been “saving religiously” for years, had been able to travel to far-flung destinations such as Lebanon, India, Estonia and Argentina to see music artists with his friends, and his perspective on life was shifting. “I was feeling just optimism and positivity in the air in these cities, that I found, frankly, missing when I would go back,” he says. “And it started to create that kind of trigger and thought in my mind, ‘Maybe there’s something else out there.” Feeling disillusioned by the life he’d thought he wanted, Bennett resigned from his job and started up his own marketing company, True Star Consulting, in 2015. “You’ve got to jump sometime in life to know if you can do it or not,” he says. Bennett also decided to take a break from the US and spend a few months traveling the world, while working remotely. Related article
      ‘Never a boring moment:’ The couple who left Canada to live in former Soviet Central Asia Later that year, he visited Lisbon, Portugal, before moving on to Cartagena, Colombia. “I knew after a week that I would never return to my old life,” he admits. “But I didn’t think I would ever permanently settle somewhere else.” While he wasn’t that enthralled by Cartagena, Bennett felt something change inside him in April 2016 when he arrived in Medellín, nicknamed the City of the Eternal Spring. “There was an energy I had never felt before,” he says. “The food and weather were awesome, the metro astoundingly pristine.” He planned another visit, and found that he experienced the same surge of energy when he returned in 2018. “But above all, I was especially taken and inspired by the happy and friendly people, who I found completely remarkable given what they had gone through.” Leaving Medellín to continue his travels, Bennett was hit with an overwhelming sense of sadness and longing. “It was then that I started to say, ‘Do you really need to leave?’” Bennett says. At the same time, he realized that he was mostly returning to San Francisco because he felt that was what was expected of him. “Well I don’t want to do that anymore,” he thought to himself. “And my happiness levels are off the charts when I’m in Medellín.” Bennett ultimately decided to “cut ties” with his life in San Francisco, and went on to sell his one-bedroom apartment there, and buy a two-bedroom property in the neighborhood of Castropol in Medellín’s El Poblado district. “As luck, or karma, would have it, I accepted an offer on my San Francisco apartment the very same weekend my offer was accepted on my Medellín apartment,” he says, before explaining that he subsequently had “a 45-day clock to unwind” his life in the US. According to Bennett, his new apartment was “roughly 80% cheaper per square foot” than his Californian abode at that time. After selling his furniture, shipping over some of his possessions to Colombia via Miami and filling two suitcases with clothes, some artifacts and his beloved coffee maker, Bennett set off to begin his new life in January 2018. “I really remember turning and locking that door,” he recalls. “And emotionally, I was done. There was no lingering. Like, ‘Is this the right thing to do?’” Bennett says he immediately felt at home in Medellín, recalling how the “warmth and kindness” of its people pulled him in. “I always have felt a draw to the Colombian people,” he says. “And specifically those from Medellín. For anyone who’s not been here, the warmth and kindness is off the charts.” Bennett says he was particularly impressed by the lengths locals were prepared to go to help others. “It’s that much more remarkable given that this city, 20 or 30 years ago, was so feared by so many,” he says, reflecting on Medellín’s controversial past. The city, the second largest in Colombia, was once home to the Medellín Cartel which, led by drug lord Pablo Escobar, terrorized the country for decades. As a result, Medellín was synonymous with cocaine and murder up until the early 2000s. “That they have chosen to create a culture and a community of love, respect and connectivity, rather than one of hate, divisiveness and anger,” adds Bennett. Although Colombia has a long association with drugs and gangs, the country’s murder rate dropped by 82% from 1993 to 2018, and crime rates in Medellín have lowered significantly over the years. “I feel safer here than they do in America, without question,” says Bennett. According to Bennett, one of the best things about living in Medellín is the quality of life. Related article
      This US couple relocated to Italy after retiring. It didn’t go according to plan “The drinking water is phenomenal,” he says. “We have our own reservoir system… The food is incredible. We can grow anything all the time. The fresh fruits. It’s such a healthy lifestyle. “The coffee level, of course, is out of control. And the amount of parks, I can take you to 10 different parks that I love.” He’s also full of praise for the country’s health care system – the World Health Organization ranked Colombia at number 22 in an analysis of 191 countries – describing it as “phenomenal.” “Healthcare is a constitutional right here,” he says. “And there is a public system that is available to everyone.” Bennett, who pays around $2,000 a year for a private medical plan, says he’s been able to build a personal relationship with his doctors in Medellín. “I have had access to the best medicalists that I have ever had in my entire life,” he says. “Not that my doctors in the United States were not good, but (here) I sit with my doctor for an hour. We talk about life. “You feel like you’re just a number and you’re rushed in and out in the United States.” Bennett is also a big fan of the city’s metro system, a network of trains, cable cars, trams and buses, which first opened in 1995 and is now one of the most successful in the world. “They started building this network during the worst of the violence, and it came to be seen as a symbol of hope for the city,” he says. “So it is the cleanest, most respected metro that you will ever come across in your life, except for maybe Japan.” Although he clearly loves being in Medellín, there are some aspects of life in the US that he misses. For Bennett, the “level of directness” of the people is probably top of the list. “The (Colombian) culture is so kind, they don’t really like to say, ‘No,’” he says. “So you ask questions, and you often don’t get a straight answer. “You’re like, ‘Come on. You can just tell me how it is. I’m not going to get mad at you.’” He goes on to explain that he finds Colombians to be more relaxed in general, and “people don’t really act with the sense of urgency that you might get in America. “I do miss that,” he admits. “But on the whole, I’m around much happier people. So I feel that it’s a worthy trade off.” Bennett notes that it can take a little while for newcomers to figure out how to get important services like bank accounts and energy services set up in the country. “It takes time,” he notes. “It’s not as quick as in America. It’s not as quick as what you might be used to. There are steps you need to take, and you have to be persistent.” When it comes to affordability, while Bennett points out that “inflation has raised prices on quite a few things compared to what they once were,” he still finds Medellín to be incredibly good value. “Excellent meals can be had for under $10, Uber is not expensive, and the world’s best coffee is less than $2 a cup,” he adds. After six years, Bennett is fully immersed in the Medellín experience and the city feels very much like home. He’s not quite fluent in Spanish yet, but after studying the language for five years, Bennett says his confidence is growing and he’s able to hold conversations reasonably comfortably. “It’s my duty as a guest to learn the language,” he says. “That’s the thing that kind of kills me about some expats, is that they don’t learn any Spanish.” Although he does have some friends in the city who are fellow Americans, Bennett says he tries to avoid hanging with “expat groups,” preferring to spend time with locals. In 2022, Bennett launched a tourism company, The Vegan Paisa, now know as The Paisa Plan, with the aim of helping others discover the “magic of Medellín.” “The name was inspired by the moniker (Paisa) for those born in Medellín,” he adds. Bennett currently has a residency visa, which he renews every five years, but plans to apply for Colombian citizenship in the future. “I want to be here for the rest of my life. It’s a reflection of who I am now,” he says. “The values that Medellin stands for are the same values that I stand for.” However, he goes on to stress that he has no plans to renounce his US citizenship. “I happily pay taxes to the US State government,” he says. “And I don’t ever want to come across as like I’m shading San Francisco or the United States in general. “But I do sense a profound energy shift when I go back to visit my family and I look at a country with abundance and with resources that are the dream of so many. “And (think) how did it devolve into constant fighting, election conspiracies, healthcare not being a right, women’s rights being taken away, guns everywhere? “They just broke every contract that you as a citizen expect of your country.” Bennett last returned to the US this May. Both of his parents have traveled over to Colombia to visit him, along with his sister Jen, over the past few years. “One of the nicest things my mom said was how she felt safe in crowds for the first time in long while,” says Bennett. While he hasn’t been able to explore much of the rest of the country, aside from visits to Bogota, Cali and Cartagena, he hopes to rectify this soon. “I have a lot more of the country that I want to see, for sure,” he adds, admitting that he misses Colombia whenever he travels elsewhere. Bennett acknowledges that many of the decisions that he’s made with regards to his career and the destination he lives in have been easier due to the fact that he’s single with no dependents. “I’ve never wanted to get married,” he says. “I don’t have kids. My time is my time. I realize that that is not the reality for a lot of people. “I’ve crafted my life that way… I decided that I wanted to have that freedom of time and location and all of that.” He advises those who are thinking of making a similar move to spend some time working towards it and coming up with a strategy. “You’ve got to have a long term plan,” he says. Since choosing to relocate to Colombia, ﻿Bennett has noticed a considerable change in his overall wellbeing and says he couldn’t be happier with how things have turned out. “As I’ve gone into my 40s, it’s lowered my stress levels immensely,” says Bennett. “I can just get around that energy and vibe and kind of soak it in. It puts me in much better health, physically and mentally, as I continue to call Medellín home.”"
The magical white stone wonderland with effervescent bathing pools,"Barry Neild,CNN","5:33 AM EDT, Mon October 14, 2024",6 minute,,"Editor’s Note: This CNN Travel series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy. From a distance, Pamukkale looks every bit like a ski resort, with a cascade of brilliant white slopes and a scattering of tourists at the top, seemingly preparing to slalom down into the valley below. So why isn’t it melting away as midsummer temperatures nudge toward 100 Fahrenheit, or 37 Celsius, and the heat hangs in the shimmering air? Because this unusual and beautiful wonder, located deep in the sunkissed hills of southwestern Turkey, isn’t snow at all. In fact the water it’s formed from sometimes spurts out of the ground at boiling point. And those visitors milling around its upper reaches aren’t going anywhere fast. Most are here to take in the extraordinary spectacle – and either paddle or soak in some of the planet’s most photogenic pools. Today, Pamukkale’s travertine limestone slopes and pools, filled with milky blue mineral water, are perfect for Instagram moments, especially as the magic hour evening sun casts their rippled surfaces in hues of pink. But this place was a tourist sensation thousands of years before social media, as first Greeks, then Romans flocked here for the thermal waters and to pay tribute at what was revered as a gateway to Hell. Today, Pamukkale and the ancient city of Hierapolis, which sprawls across the plateau above the white terraces, are part of a UNESCO World Heritage site that pulls in coachloads of visitors. Typically, many visit for a couple of hours, but it’s worth spending at least a day in this geological and historical playground. Enter from the South Gate – tickets cost 30 euros (about $33) – and it’s easy to be initially underwhelmed. There’s not much to see right away apart from a few toppled ancient columns, which are a frequent sight around this part of Turkey. In truth, the site of Hierapolis and Pamukkale is huge, so it takes a while to reach the good stuff (golf buggies can be rented for those really pressed for time or unable to walk the distances here). But it also means that the big reveal, when it comes, is even better. After 10 minutes of strolling along paved pathways from the gate, the line of trees that marks the edge of the plateau comes into sight. Even if you know what’s coming, there’s still a wow factor when you finally reach it, and the spectacle of that white landscape is revealed. Over millennia, the calcite deposited by the thermal water sputtering out of the ground has reshaped this hillside, creating white terraces that give the area its name - Pamukkale means cotton castle in Turkish. These terraces once held myriad naturally formed blue pools. Most of these are now empty of water and off limits, leading to some complaints that the site no longer lives up to photographs that show it in years gone by. “It is pretty, but there’s not as much water as I’d expected,” says Mary Huang, a tourist from Guangzhou in southern China, posing for a photograph on the edge of one of the pools. “The view is gorgeous though.” Related article
      The ancient monastery hanging from the side of a cliff There’s still an impressive series of serene pools, which cascade down the hill. It’s a fun spot for paddling or lying down in shallow waters and mud said to have therapeutic properties. To explore the terraces, visitors need to remove their footwear. The rock is uncomfortable and slippery in places, but it doesn’t take long to reach the first in the series of pools where toes sink into soft sediment. The top terraces are the busiest, but for those willing to make their way further down, there’s every chance of grabbing a pool to themselves. DJ Tiz, a South Korean music producer on a road trip across Turkey with his partner, singer Fre Naz, is among those slapping mud all over, under the watchful eye of an amicable dog. Having already sampled plenty of the country’s stunning landscapes, he declares: “I love Pamukkale the best.” For a more complete spa experience, there’s the Antique Pool, about five minutes’ walk from the top of the terraces. Here, for a small extra fee, visitors can use changing rooms and bathe and swim in crystal clear thermal waters over the toppled ruins of an ancient temple to Apollo. Better still, as you near the source of the water, in one corner of the pool, it becomes filled with tiny, fizzing bubbles – it’s like swimming in warm Champagne or soda. The water is said to offer relief to skin, cardiovascular and rheumatic complaints. Drinking from a water pump here is also said to work for digestive conditions. Related article
      The ghost town that has stood empty for more than a century You can spend hours wandering around the remains of Hierapolis – high spots include the wide 2nd century agora marketplace, the magnificent Roman theater and the tombs of the necropolis. The size of the site reveals the city’s one-time power and popularity (it even rates a namecheck in the Bible alongside another nearby ruined city, Laodicea, which is also worth a visit). Much of Hierapolis’ status was derived from the geothermal forces lurking beneath its surface. While many of the Romans and Greeks who came to the city were undoubtedly here for the warm waters, the place had great religious significance as the site of a Plutonium cave, or entrance to Hell. Here, much to the amazement of onlookers, sacrificial animals such as bulls would drop dead after breathing in noxious carbon dioxide fumes swirling up from below. The priests, who led them in would emerge unscathed, having learned to hold their breath. Today, the Plutonium - sited between the Ancient Pool and the Roman theater - is another high point on the tour of Hierapolis, and one of many places in the city worth visiting in the cooler evenings when, after nightfall, some attractions are dramatically illuminated. While Pamukkale is enjoying more modern fame thanks to its photogenic appearance in social media posts, some locals lament the changing nature of tourism to the area. Related article
      The ‘Hidden Valley’ where tourists wade through icy water to reach a secret waterfall Ali Durmuş, who runs Pamukkale-based tour company Turkey Magic Travel, says the roping off of much of the travertines and diversion of water since it became a UNESCO World Heritage site has robbed visitors of an experience enjoyed for millennia. He says it puts them off staying longer. Pammukale’s UNESCO-listing led to on-site hotels being demolished, new pools constructed, water redirected down manmade channels, improved site management and closure of the slopes to reverse degradation that had changed them from white to gray. “If they cannot enjoy the water, then they are not staying long. Maybe one night or just visiting for an afternoon,” Durmuş says. He worries that the diminished experience has meant people miss out on exploring the surrounding area, which has other geothermal attractions. Towns stretching out northwest from Pamukkale along a geological fault line tap into increasingly hotter supplies of steam and water surging up from underground. About 20 minutes’ drive northwest up the surrounding Denizli Basin, the town of Karahayit has spas and heating systems based around the iron-rich red waters that emerge at around 50 Celsius (122 Fahrenheit). The town also has a lovely covered market, with street vendors selling delicious local mulberry juice. Further away, in Buharkent – its name meaning steam city - water at boiling point powers what was Turkey’s first geothermal power station. In winter, it has been known to sometimes get chilly enough to snow in Pamukkale, but thanks to the primal forces that thrust up from its hellish subterranean portals and paint the hillsides white, it’s always a hot destination."
What the rising popularity of Yemeni coffee shops says about third places,"Ramishah Maruf,Monica Haider,CNN","2:00 AM EDT, Sat October 26, 2024",6 minute,,"The most popular spot on a late Friday night in a pocket of Manhattan’s West Village isn’t a trendy bar or a Michelin-starred restaurant but a Yemeni coffee house chain strictly serving coffee, tea and pastries. A step into Qahwah House on Carmine Street offers a rich whiff of cardamom, Arabic music and crowds of people both at tables and in line to order. The energy spills over into the sidewalk, where some begin performing a Levantine folk dance known as dabke. It’s a snapshot of various Eastern cultures; Arabic, Farsi and Urdu fill the air, and some customers don traditional attire. Qahwah House is just one of a string of Yemeni coffee chains that originated in the Arab-populated Detroit area and are rapidly springing up across the country, often where there are significant Middle Eastern and Muslim populations. Nineteen Qahwah House locations are open across seven states, with more under construction and expected to open this year. Another chain, Haraz, opened this month in the pricey SoHo neighborhood in Manhattan, with at least six more in the region planned in the next two years. Times Square will be home to two other chains, MOKAFÉ and Qamaria Yemeni Coffee Co. The rapid expansion of these shops underscores the demand for late-night social spots for not only young Muslims and Middle Easterners, but also younger people who are looking for a non-digital third space where they can hang out without alcohol or having to yell over loud music. They don’t have many other options. Malls, a traditional third place for young people, are growing more and more unpopular. Chains like Starbucks have become more like take-out counters. Alcohol-free lifestyles are growing even for those outside of the Muslim faith, which many practicing the religion already take part in. So for many young people in urban areas, especially those from immigrant communities looking for a way to connect to their cultures, it’s a great option. In New York “people like to go out clubbing,” Bhavishya Banda, a strategy consultant, said one late night at Qahwah House. “Personally, I don’t find enjoyment in that. But I want to go out at night.” Third spaces are not a new concept. Sober bars popping up across the country aim to build a sense of community and social connections. But Yemeni coffee houses have taken up both those trends and boomed. Younger people, particularly the children of immigrants who are straddling two different cultures “enjoy the fact that they’re consuming something that is really kind of traditional, but in this very new, modern, contemporary context,” said Sally Howell, professor of Arab American studies at the University of Michigan–Dearborn. In the Middle East, coffee isn’t a grab-and-go drink used to wake up with, but a social exchange. While coffee beans originated in Ethiopia, the earliest evidence of cultivation appeared in Yemen through trading across the Red Sea. The practice followed into the early 20th century and across the world, when the first wave of Middle Eastern immigrants came to Detroit to work in the auto industry or shipping yards, Howell said. Most immigrants were men who migrated alone, so one of the first institutions they created were coffee houses where they would gather to socialize, share news about their home country, and even write letters back home. Many of the initial mosques in the area were originally established in the backs of the coffee houses. Yemeni men working in shipping on the Great Lakes “would work for months at a time and then have a few weeks off and then work again,” leaving them unable to visit their families back in Yemen, Howell said. “The coffee houses in the Detroit area were a really important institution.” “Our mission is to bring everyone in one place and share history,” Ibrahim Alhasbani, founder of the first contemporary Yemeni coffee chain Qahwah House, told CNN. “That’s why we serve the coffee in a pot. People come inside the store and they share one pot and they can talk and they share different stories.” Contemporary chains are designed by a new demographic — the descendants of these immigrants who are bringing Yemeni coffee culture to the American mainstream. The very first Qahwah Houses in Dearborn were airy and upscale, a familiar setting to patrons of established coffee chains. But they also brought with them Yemeni culture, with coffee beans imported from local farmers, artifacts from the region and the founder’s family tree on the wall. “I come from a background of family farmers. We own the coffee farms in Yemen, we grew up with the coffee, we loved coffee,” Alhasbani said. The new generation of Yemenis in the area benefitted from the support of a more established community, Howell said. Those like Alhasbani came in with investors: Yemeni entrepreneurs, professionals, medical professionals and engineers who give back to their community by sponsoring younger people. Business experts say customers are attracted to authenticity. For example, Alhasbani hand mixes the ingredients for the drinks at his factory in Michigan and the coffee beans still come from farmers in Yemen. “There’s been a lot of emphasis, especially in specialty coffee but also in the entertainment space, on being authentic and being real,” Hovig Tchalian, Assistant Professor of Clinical Entrepreneurship at USC Marshall School of Business, told CNN. During the day, Yemeni coffeehouses function similar to many neighborhood spots. Patrons host meetings, college students study and others pop in for a quick cup to-go. But at night, they serve as de-facto living rooms, especially for young Muslims who don’t go to clubs and bar. From New York to Dallas, especially during the late nights of Ramadan, the crowd overflows into the street and you often have to yell to be heard inside. Some young Muslims even venture to the coffee shops in hopes of finding a life partner. Nowhere is this coffeehouse culture more pronounced, and celebrated, than in Dearborn, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit and home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the United States. Downtown Dearborn is peppered with different Yemeni coffee houses, which Howell said helped revitalize the Detroit area after the city became the largest municipality go to bankrupt in 2013. And it’s only growing. “It’s become sort of contagious,” Howell said. “Several Yemeni entrepreneurs are opening coffee houses of their own, each with its own sort of style and atmosphere.” The coffee chains have big ambitions beyond Dearborn. Qahwah House hopes to open another 20 to 30 locations in the next year, spanning across 12 states and Canada, Alhasbani said. They are also licensed out, but Alhasbani says he sets a high standard before agreeing to let anyone open a shop. “We have too many people that come (asking me) they want to open. I have more than 10 different requests a day just to open this kind of business,” he said. “We don’t give anyone license until we make sure the person has the love for the brand and his mind and his heart in the Qahwah House.” Another authentic Yemeni coffee chain, Haraz, also sees crowds of people throughout the day and night. They opened their first location in New York City last week — less than half a mile away from Qahwah House’s downtown Manhattan shop — and the franchisees plan to grow. But growth isn’t without challenges. Haraz directly sources its coffee from the high-altitude region in Yemen it’s named after. Since shipping from the Red Sea has become difficult or delayed, co-franchisee Ahmed Moustafa said they have three years of beans on reserve in Michigan so they can keep up with demand while preserving the original flavor. At Haraz’s newest location, the space visibly resembles Islamic architecture, with pointed arches adorning the walls. But its location in pricey Soho aims to branch outside of the Middle Eastern communities in Brooklyn and Queens. “I had feedback from a lady that lives around the block, she said ‘I didn’t even know about coffee from Yemen,’” Moustafa said."
Jury awards Apple $250 in design patent lawsuit against Masimo,Reuters,"7:08 PM EDT, Fri October 25, 2024",2 minute,,"Apple convinced a federal jury on Friday that health monitoring tech company Masimo’s smartwatches infringe two of its design patents. The jury, in Delaware, agreed with Apple that Masimo’s W1 and Freedom watches and chargers willfully violated Apple’s patent rights in smartwatch designs, awarding the tech giant $250 in damages. Apple’s attorneys told the court the “ultimate purpose” of its lawsuit was to win an injunction against sales of Masimo’s smartwatches after an infringement ruling. The jury also determined that Masimo’s watches did not infringe Apple patents covering smartwatch inventions that the tech giant had accused Masimo of copying. Masimo said in a statement that the company appreciated the jury’s verdict “in favor of Masimo and against Apple on nearly all issues,” and that the decision only applied to a “discontinued module and charger.” “Apple primarily sought an injunction against Masimo’s current products, and the jury’s verdict is a victory for Masimo on that issue,” Masimo said. Apple said in a statement that it was “glad the jury’s decision today will protect the innovations we advance on behalf of our customers.” Irvine, California-based Masimo accused Apple of hiring away its employees and stealing its pulse oximetry technology after discussing a potential collaboration. Masimo convinced the U.S. International Trade Commission last year to block imports of Apple’s Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches after the commission found that their technology for reading blood oxygen levels infringed Masimo’s patents. Apple has appealed the decision and resumed selling the watches after removing the technology. The tech giant countersued Masimo for patent infringement in 2022, alleging that Masimo copied Apple Watch features to use in its smartwatches. Apple also accused Masimo of using lawsuits at the ITC and in California to “make way for Masimo’s own watch.” Masimo said Apple’s patent lawsuit was “retaliatory” and “an attempt to avoid the court in which the parties have been litigating their dispute.”"
"Why Nike, Starbucks and Boeing have lost their magic","alysis by Allison Morrow,CNN","10:42 AM EDT, Fri October 25, 2024",3 minute,,"A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here. Three quintessentially American companies — Starbucks, Nike and Boeing — share a common predicament at the moment. Each has a new CEO at the helm with a mission to clean house and, critically, return the brand to its former glory. None of them have an easy job ahead, as this week made painfully clear. Here’s the tea: A preliminary earnings report Tuesday revealed yet another quarter of falling sales at Starbucks — its third in a row. The drop was especially steep in the US, where sales fell 10%; and in China, where they were down 14%. Basically, demand hasn’t been this low since the first year of the pandemic. The numbers were so ugly that Starbucks took the uncommon step of suspending its financial guidance for the rest of the year — a move that should, in theory, give the new boss time to figure out a plan.

      Starbucks reveals what an enormous mess its new CEO has to clean up Brian Niccol took the reins last month, leaving the top job at Chipotle to become Starbucks’ third CEO in three years. But even for Niccol, the guy known throughout the industry as something of a savior to spiraling companies, this is going to be a Herculean task. So far, Niccol has said he wants to simplify the menus, improve staffing levels and he may even — please, for the love of God — put the milk and sugar out from behind the counter. “We need to fundamentally change our strategy so we can get back to growth,” he said. “People love Starbucks, but I’ve heard from some customers that we’ve drifted from our core.” In short: Bring back the chill community coffee shop vibe from the ’90s. And maybe stop trying to make us drink olive oil. Nike is in a similar boat. Its stock is down some 25% this year, and revenue fell 10% last quarter from a year earlier. Like Starbucks, it’s got a new boss who everyone hopes will swoop in with big ideas to return the brand to its former glory. Easier said than done, of course. Nike’s problems stem from its own strategic missteps — like not focusing enough on making cool shoes — as well as growing competition from younger upstart brands like Hoka and On. The new guy, Elliott Hill, is only a couple of weeks in but already secured a 12-season extension of Nike’s partnership with the NBA and WNBA, ensuring the swoosh will stay on pro-basketball’s uniforms and official apparel. Next on the list of to-dos: Figure out how to make the shoes cool again. And finally, there’s Boeing. Boeing Boeing Boeing…. Things were already a shambles when Kelly Ortberg took over as CEO in August, and somehow they’ve actually deteriorated. On Wednesday, union workers who’ve been striking for the past six weeks rejected Boeing’s offer to return to work, meaning the work stoppage that’s draining about $1 billion a month from the company will carry on. Oh, and on the same day, Boeing reported a $6 billion third-quarter loss, one of the largest quarterly losses in the company’s history. All of that’s happening on the heels of a year that started with one of its plane’s door plugs blowing out in mid-air. Which came on the heels of a six-year chapter marked by dual tragedies, damning revelations about the company’s systemic failures and the near-total erosion of Boeing’s reputation for quality and safety. Like Nike and Starbucks, Boeing is looking to its past self to guide its future. Unfortunately for Ortberg, the rot goes back well over a decade. And Boeing won’t be able to build the time machine it so desperately needs without the 33,000 machinists currently on strike."
