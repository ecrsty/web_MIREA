								video Thousands of Tommy Robinson supporters marched through central London today. A demonstration left Victoria Station to reach Westminster before it was ground to a halt at Buckingham Gate. ‘Shall we burst through and f*** [the police] up?’ one man shouted. Others urged for calm, with one saying: ‘The police are trying to rile us up. It is a disgrace. We need to try and stay calm. ‘We started, why have we stopped? We need to smile. They want a problem.’ Later there was ‘a brief moment of shoving’ near the stage of an anti-fascist counter-protest, leading to two arrests, according to police. One was arrested for a public order offence and a breach of the peace, while the other was arrested for a racially aggravated public order offence. Police subsequently de-arrested one of them. Chants of ‘Oh Tommy, Tommy’ carried as the main demonstration reached Parliament where it was met with heavy police presence. People at the front of the march carried a sign with ‘Two tier Keir fuelled the riots’ written on it. Other cards said ‘Bring back Rwanda’ and ‘Stop the Boats’. Some appeared to chant ‘Who the f*** is Allah?’ and ‘We want Tommy out!’ while drinking from beer cans. To get the latest news from the capital visit Metro.co.uk's London news hub. Although Robinson wasn’t at the protest in person, he did appear in a video message in which he criticised alleged two-tier policing and London’s Ulez charges. The crowd booed when an image of Prime Minister Keir Starmer appeared on the same screen at the front of the demonstration. Far-right activist Tommy Robinson is absent from the protest – that he organised – after being charged with a terror offence on Friday. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was remanded into custody by police on Friday. He is accused of being in contempt of court following the airing of a film at a rally in central London. After attending Folkestone Police station, he was separately charged with failing to provide his mobile phone pin to police under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, Kent Police said. A post from his X account last night said: ‘We do not care if you are black, brown, white or green, what we care about are shared values, our culture, and the direction of our nation.’ Former GB News host Laurence Fox, who dubbed Robinson a ‘political prisoner’, pulled out of the protest over concerns it would not proceed peacefully. In a post on X, the former actor said: ‘Having been involved in the planning and funding of the previous marches and having some understanding of the huge efforts required to make these events pass peacefully, I am concerned that the current climate makes our task even more onerous. ‘I am not sufficiently reassured that the preparations which have been put in place to ensure the first marches passed so peacefully is sufficiently robust to make sure this one does the same. I am sincerely looking forward to being proved wrong.’ Riot police arrived at Westminster ahead of the demonstration, which set off more than an hour ahead of an agreed 12.30pm start time. Many of the the English Defence League founder’s supporters are holding signs saying ‘enough is enough’ and ‘immigrants are not welcome, stop rewarding, start deporting, defend our borders’. There are chants of ‘free Tommy Robinson’, ‘we want Tommy out’ and ‘who the f*** is Allah, I’m England until I die’ from attendees. One protester told Metro: ‘This is all about freedom. The country is corrupt.’ Counter-protesters gather at the other end of Whitehall after a march from Regent Street, organised by Stand Up To Racism, which described it as a ‘massive anti-fascist demonstration’. Both demonstrations are supposed to remain static, but police are on site in case tensions bubble over. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Rachel Williams said: ‘We are well prepared for what is set to be a busy day in the centre of London. ‘Our role is to ensure that those attending the various events can do so safely and that they can exercise their right to lawful protest. ‘We will have significant resources in place to respond to any incidents, to deal decisively with any offences, and to keep disruption to other members of the public and businesses to a minimum. ‘We know that when groups with opposing views come together it can lead to conflict and disorder and a key part of our role is ensuring that does not happen. ‘We have used Public Order Act conditions to ensure that those involved stick to routes and assembly areas that are sufficiently far apart.

Hospital staff watched young woman die on CCTV thinking she was asleep,Sam Corbishley,"Oct 26, 2024, 5:53pm",,"Home,News,UK","Hospital staff watched a young woman lie dying on the floor for more than an hour because they thought she was asleep, an inquest has been told. Shannara Donnelly, 22, was supposed to be watched ‘at all times’ after being deemed a risk of self-harm while at Chase Farm Hospital in Enfield, north London. But medical staff wrongly monitored her using cameras and missed her collapsing in her room at the unit on June 19. The inquest at George Meehan House in Wood Green heard that when they saw Shannara lying on the floor, they assumed she was sleeping, and she remained there for over an hour. The hearing, which is expected to last up to two weeks, was told she died ‘apparently by her own hands’. Shannara, known to her family as Jade, had reported previous sexual abuse, had struggled with alcohol abuse and sometimes heard ‘voices’ in her head, the inquest has heard. Her mum, Kerry Donnelly, explained that Jade had struggled during lockdown and had recently lost three close members of her family before her death. She said of her daughter: ‘The pain was sometimes just too unbearable for her. As such, she had stayed in different places whilst she tried to get help and where she would be safe. ‘Tragically, whilst in [the care of Chase Farm Hospital] on June 19, a very beautiful leaf fell from our family tree, but the memories of Jade will remain deep-rooted in our hearts forever.’ The court has heard that despite a note on her health documents stating she shouldn’t be sent to Chase Farm Hospital following a previous incident, Jade was again admitted to the unit after previous stays at St Ann’s Hospital in Haringey. Area Coroner Tony Murphy read admissions from the Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust, including that Jade ‘shouldn’t have been sent’ to Chase Farm Hospital, that her risk assessment was inadequate, and that she ‘should have been within eyesight observations’. The Trust further admitted that necessary safety checks were not carried out by nursing staff at the facility, which was also housing another patient at the time, and that CCTV observations by staff were an inadequate form of observation. Additionally, no staff on shift were compliant with their life support training and of the two oxygen tanks kept at the unit, one was empty and the other missing an essential attachment. CCTV footage played to jurors from the day of Jade’s death showed members of staff observing the girl on cameras and through ‘peephole’ windows, but not completing observations required under her level of care. Mark Pritchard, Managing Director at Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust, began his evidence by apologising to Jade’s family. ‘I want to offer my sincere condolences, on behalf of the Trust, for the shortcomings in Jade’s death,’ he said. Mr Murphy took the court through the Trust’s policy guidelines for patients under Level Three care, which Jade was under, which states they should be within sight ‘at all times’. Guidelines also stated that though CCTV observation could be used to support staff, ‘it should not be used in place of observations and engagement’. They also stated patients should be observed ‘attentively’. Mr Murphy asked Mr Pritchard: ‘Does it appear to you that, during the footage you saw, that Jade’s observation was conducted by staff attentively?’ He answered: ‘No, I don’t believe it was.’ Jade’s family’s lawyer, Ross Beaton, later questioned Mr Pritchard on whether Jade’s level of care was provided effectively. Mr Beaton said: ‘Level Three means being within eyesight unless [the patient] is in the bathroom, in which case you will be in verbal contact [with them]. ‘Did you see any Level Three observations [in the CCTV footage]?’ Mr Pritchard replied: ‘The bulk of it, I would say no. The overarching answer is no.’ Jane Basemera, Jade’s allocated nurse on the day of her death, told the court the patient would have lived had she been on Level Four observations. Ms Basemera, who broke down in tears during her evidence, said: ‘If a patient has [tried to use a] ligature, it should be arm’s length [Level Four care]. ‘Arms-length observations would have saved Jade.’ Mr Murphy said: ‘It does appear that some very significant events that occurred to Jade during the time in the bathroom were missed.’ Heartbreaking tributes to boy, 14, found dead after vanishing on way to school Boy, 2, and girl, 8, in hospital after stabbing attack in east London Arrests after thousands take part in Tommy Robinson march and counter protest Maps show where Tommy Robinson march and counter-protest are happening in London today Ms Basemera accepted that this was true, but also spoke of staffing issues at the unit, saying Jade should have had two nurses looking after her. The nurse admitted she’d been told that Jade was on the floor but hadn’t been told of her collapse. If she had been told, she said she would have known ‘without a doubt’ that something was wrong, the inquest heard. The inquest continues.

Warning ahead of Manchester City match after body found near stadium,Danny Rigg,"Oct 26, 2024, 2:58pm","Oct 26, 2024, 4:47pm","Home,News,UK","Football fans have been told to find alternative routes to Manchester City’s ground after a body was found by a canalside path to the Etihad Stadium. Police have taped off an area around Ashton Canal, where the body – believed to be a man – was discovered this morning, Manchester Evening News reported. The death is not believed to be suspicious, but emergency services and a forensic tent remained on the scene until shortly before today’s match at the nearby grounds. Police tape blocks off a section of Clayton Lane and a canal towpath, a popular route to the Etihad Stadium, which is less than a mile away. Manchester City is hosting Southampton at the stadium for a Premier League match with a 3pm kick off. Several police cars and an ambulance were on the scene, according to eyewitnesses.

Nostradamus and Baba Vanga both made the same chilling prediction for 2025,Gergana Krasteva,"Oct 26, 2024, 12:26pm","Oct 26, 2024, 3:40pm","Home,News,World","Baba Vanga and Nostradamus – who are known worldwide for their uncannily accurate prophecies – have made the same exact prediction for 2025. Both have foretold troubling futures – about aliens making contact with humans, a supposed assassination attempt on Vladimir Putin, terrorist attacks in Europe and about King Charles’ reign. With 2025 knocking on our doorstep, their prophecies are yet again in the spotlight. Both mystics have made chilling claims that there will be a conflict in Europe next year. Baba Vanga, often described as the ‘Nostradamus of the Balkans’, predicted a war in Europe for 2025, which she said would ‘devastate’ the continent’s population. As if the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine is not harrowing enough, she saidthat a new conflict will erupt between two countries. Bulgaria’s legendary mystic made a name for herself across Europe predicting the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine, the death of Princess Diana, New York’s 9/11, even her own death on August 11, 1996, at the age of 85, her followers claim. For those who have somehow never come across her life story, she lived in Rupite, a small mountainous village to which various eastern European and Soviet leaders trekked to just for a chance to seek her wisdom. Blind since early childhood, she was semi-literate in Bulgarian and although she did not record her prophecies, her followers wrote them down, later turning them into books.

Ex-Chelsea and England star Frank Lampard speaks out after face is found in £38m drugs bust,Tom Olver,"Oct 26, 2024, 9:53am","Oct 26, 2024, 11:59am","Home,Sport,Football","Ex-Chelsea and England footballer Frank Lampard was left near-speechless after he was informed that pictures of his face had been discovered in a £38million drugs bust in Australia. Two duffel bags were seized by the Australian Federal Police and each and every brick – containing ‘ice meth’ – had bizarrely been stamped with photos of a suited-up Lampard giving a thumbs up. The picture in question was taken while Lampard was giving a lap of honour at Stamford Bridge back in 2017 and appears on the former midfielder’s Wikipedia page. Richard Prothero, an alleged trafficker, was arrested at gunpoint during the enormous haul, which occurred in the car park of Sydney’s Maroubra Surf Club. The 37-year-old was subsequently charged with attempting to possess a commercial quantity of border-controlled drugs. He made no application for bail while appearing in court. The 95kg shipment of methamphetamine had been tracked from Los Angeles, before it wound up in east Sydney. It goes without saying that Lampard, who was capped 106 times by the England national team, had no involvement whatsoever in the drugs ring and the 46-year-old could hardly believe his eyes when shown snaps from the incident. ‘Yeah, you probably know my answer on that one,’ a baffled Lampard told The Sun outside his west London home. ‘What am I gonna say about that? I’m not aware of it. ‘I don’t even know what to say to you to be honest. I’ve literally no comment on that.’ According to reports Down Under, the drug producer in question may be a Chelsea supporter which could explain why Lampard’s face had been plastered all over the stash. It is believed the image of Lampard may be a trademark of the criminal gang supplying the illegal substance. ‘Methamphetamine, like all illicit drugs, causes psychological, financial and social harm to users, their loved ones and the broader community,’ Australian Federal Police Detective Chief Superintendent Kristie Cressy said in a statement. ‘Criminals do not care about the harm they cause. They are motivated by the profits they can make. Across Australia there were 10,100 methamphetamine-related hospitalisations in 2021-2022 – which equates to more than 27 every day on average. ‘This has an impact on the health system that can negatively affect the entire community. Investigations like this show the resolve and relentlessness of our investigators in making Australia a hostile environment for organised crime.’ Back in 2012, Lampard’s former Chelsea and England team-mate, John Terry, sought legal action against Golden Flake after images of his face and torso were used on packets of Indian cigarettes. 'I coached Cole Palmer with England - he's brilliant but has one weakness' West Ham tipped to sign 'very good' Chelsea star after Enzo Maresca treatment Didi Hamann says Arsenal star has 'gone backwards' and will only get worse Alan Shearer's Premier League predictions including 'huge' Arsenal vs Liverpool clash A spokesman for Elite Management, the firm representing Terry, insisted the Indian government has sought no permission to use the picture. ‘Disgusting from this company Gold Flake using my image on their cigarettes,’ the ex-Three Lions captain told his followers on social media at the time. I hate smoking!’ Lampard, widely regarded as one of the finest midfielders of his generation, has been out of a job since his interim spell as Chelsea manager came to an end at the conclusion of the 2022/23 season. He has, though, worked in various punditry roles for the BBC, TNT Sports and Amazon Prime in recent months. For more stories like this, check our sport page.

My husband never bothers with affection or foreplay — our sex life is a one-way street,Laura Collins,"Oct 26, 2024, 6:00pm",,"Home,Lifestyle,Sex","Even if you don’t give your partner pleasure to receive it in return, when sex is continually one-sided, it can leave you feeling short-changed. In this week’s Sex Column, we hear from a reader whose husband is neglecting her needs in the bedroom, avoiding foreplay altogether and skipping straight to what he enjoys. When he’s had a drink, he has no trouble giving his wife the affection she craves — but by this point, she’s feeling anything but receptive. Read the advice below, but before you go, don’t forget to check out last week’s column, from a woman who’s struggling to come to terms with the revelation her boyfriend is a cross-dresser. My husband has lots of qualities but one of them isn’t that he’s a great romantic. He rarely shows me any affection unless he’s been drinking, and then he’s full of undying love and all over me like the proverbial rash. But at the very time he’s trying to be all lovey-dovey, I just feel annoyed because I feel it’s the drink talking. The rest of the time, when we’re in bed and he’s stone cold sober, he never bothers to try to turn me on, and just jumps on me for sex without any foreplay at all. (Sorry if this is too much information but I don’t know how else to say it.) I’ve tried talking to him about it but he only gets annoyed and I often end up in tears. I love him very much and apart from the sex issue, he’d do anything for me. We’re both in our late twenties and have been together just over three years. We’ve always had the same problem, which I imagined would improve with time, but no such luck. I’ve tried pointing him to useful websites, or giving him books on the subject, but he flatly refuses to engage. I’ve told him the things I enjoy, which ought to be obvious to any man trying to please his wife sexually, but he won’t do them. I always take the trouble for him, so why can’t I have some pleasure in return? This issue is making me really unhappy but it doesn’t seem to bother him. Assuming everything else is good in your relationship, don’t give up just yet. If your husband can be loving and affectionate when drunk, he can be loving and affectionate when sober. However, this problem need to be addressed, as intimacy should never be a one-way street. It seems as if it’s something that actually bothers him a great deal, despite him showing it in a different way. The fact that he gets annoyed when you try talking about it is likely a defence mechanism, and while I’m sure he doesn’t want you to end up in tears, at least when you do, the focus is temporarily off him. Your husband may have been brought up in a household where he was expected to behave in a tough, unemotional way. But buried beneath that ‘manly’ exterior is the sensitive and affectionate lover he can be when alcohol lowers the barriers and releases his inhibitions. It’s important to focus on the positives when broaching this, as pointing out any shortcomings in the bedroom will just make him feel worse and more defensive. Instead, try boosting his confidence by telling him how the thought of great sex with him turns you on, and how wonderful it is when he does certain things to you. I asked my partner to plan a date night - his idea of romance left me shocked ‘Talk dirty to me,’ I said - then my lover went quiet There's a phrase that people hate even more than 'live, laugh, love' I haven't had sex in two years, but I'm ready to end my dry spell Additionally, you could look at taking more of an initiative so that you’re the one doing the seducing, which gives you greater control of what happens and how. Maybe he just needs a bit of practical ‘teaching’ about what feels good. Making this a fun thing, where you’re both exploring new ways to improve your sex life, is key to getting him on board. Hopefully he starts to make more of an effort, but either way, a few sessions with a sex therapist will help you (and him) get to the root of his issues. Laura is a counsellor and columnist.

Think twice before you label Strictly Come Dancing’s Shayne Ward,Adam Miller,"Oct 26, 2024, 4:00pm",,"Home,Entertainment,TV","If you’re old enough to remember Shayne Ward on The X Factor, you’ll recall the hold he had on millions of us back in 2005. It helped that he wouldn’t look out of place in a Dolce & Gabbana advert and had an impeccable falsetto when male popstars hitting those high notes was all the rage. Listen to Daniel Bedingfield and Justin Timberlake for reference. But is that alone enough to win one of the biggest public votes of the 00s? No, the public have to love you for you, too. Shayne looked like a model and sounded like pop prince but ultimately he was a humble lad from Manchester you could easily find in any town centre centre folding clothes or pulling pints. He was a confident performer, sure, but he wasn’t cocky. There’s a fine line between the two and for some reason 20 years later, now he’s appearing on The X Factor’s rival series Strictly Come Dancing, viewers think that line has been crossed. But has it? Considering he was famed for his ballads as a popstar, Shayne is actually a much better dancer than I was expecting. Not to diminish his underrated up-tempo bops like No You Hang Up, but when I think of Shayne Ward I don’t think of dancer. To my surprise, he’s actually pretty decent and has so far proven to be a dab-hand at all the styles of the ballroom. His American Smooth last weekend felt effortless, and his chemistry with professional partner Nancy Xu has never felt stronger. The week before his Cha-cha was fun, even if it was a little bit clunky. The judges loved it and he was sitting pretty comfortably at fifth on the leaderboard going into the public vote. He should have been a safe bet to sail through to week five but against all odds he found himself in the bottom two with Nick Knowles, eventually saved by the judges. It was the confirmation Shayne didn’t need: The public have hung up. He’s since been spared the dance-off for one weekend, but is tipped by bookies to end up there again tonight for Halloween Week. It’s unclear why Strictly viewers aren’t gelling with Shayne, but glancing on social media, the overwhelming response is he’s ‘arrogant’ because he said at the beginning of the contest he’s ‘in it to win it’. Granted, the competitive nature of Strictly Come Dancing has been increasingly scrutinised since the sacking of Graziano Di Prima and probe into Giovanni Pernice’s teaching style in training. On one side, people have said Strictly is just a bit of fun while others are adamant it is still a dance contest, which as we’ve seen time and time again can also really boost someone’s career. But can’t it be both? Of course, Shayne is in it to win it – and quite rightly, he’s not the only one. Every single one of them is willingly pushing themselves to breaking point because they all want to survive another week and ultimately lift the Glitterball trophy. There’s a reason no one has rejected the Glitterball trophy – everyone wants to take it home. Why wouldn’t you? At least Shayne was honest about it. I can’t say I’m picking up the phone voting for Shayne to win. It’s going to take a lot for me to vote for anyone other than Montell (Chris, you don’t need my vote), but I’m absolutely baffled that he’s not a safe bet each week, and has been accused of being overly confident. After his American Smooth last Saturday, Shirley Ballas had some welcome advice for Shayne. She said: ‘What I want you to search for now, just a little deeper, is your authentic self. ‘Who are you really? You don’t need to put a show on for anybody except yourself. You are that good.’ She’s right, too. Part of the reason the public isn’t engaging with Shayne is because they’re struggling to see the real him. But is that cockiness? If anything, to me, he looks nervous and a little overwhelmed no doubt triggered by exaggerated and unwarranted backlash to one of the first comments he made on the show. Unlike other contestants, with exception of fell X Factor alumni JB Gill of JLS fame, Shayne has ridden this rodeo before. He’s given himself up to the security of the public vote each week and experienced the extraordinary level of attention that comes with it.

My daughter got caught in a hailstorm and it changed her forever,Emily Streeter,"Oct 26, 2024, 1:00pm",,"Home,Lifestyle,Families","I watch as my 11-year-old paces from window to window, hands pressed so tightly over her ears that her fingernails break skin. I’ve seen this before – the panic, the screams, the vomit – and my heart breaks because there’s nothing I can do for her. Other times I’ve tried to hold her, but she wriggles free. We’ve drawn curtains, but she wants to watch. And so I’ve held her hair back when it’s so bad she vomits. What we thought she’d grow out of, has become a 10-year battle against ombrophobia (fear of rain), astraphobia (fear of storms), ancraophobia (fear of wind), and emetophobia (fear of vomiting). This isn’t the way most react to rain. While you or I might pull up a hood or run for cover, Poppy goes into full fight or flight mode. But she wasn’t always like this. As a toddler she was content and adventurous. She loved the woods, and hunting fairies. She was happy. All the time. Then, when she was two years old, the hailstorm happened. It had been a hot day – I was in flip flops, Poppy had bare legs and feet – then out of nowhere, daylight vanished and was replaced by dark, heavy clouds. The air became still for a moment, before hailstones began to fall. They were large, heavy, and unrelenting. Poppy was strapped in the buggy, so I stood over her, shielding her with my back. I possibly screamed in shock, but I knew the storm would pass. And then it was over, the sun returned, it was as if nothing had happened. But that moment changed everything. I know because when a therapist or doctor asks what started it, I always come back to that storm. Since then, Poppy’s fear of rain has intensified. By the age of six she could tell you what a jet stream was because her incessant need to know what is happening has also educated her beyond her years. When she got her first phone at nine, she began to fixate on weather apps and started to track lightning as far away as Italy. In lighter moments, we joke that she’ll become a meteorologist, or a storm chaser. Well-meaning people suggest removing the apps, but we feel like knowledge is power, and she needs to be in control of something that is uncontrollable. For her, knowing what might be coming is as good as it is ever going to get. But life has become increasingly hard for us all – earlier this month, she started secondary school and on day three, we had 15 millimetres of rain in an hour. She came home. While peers were forming friendships and navigating halls, she was under a duvet, her head in my lap, and fingers in her ears. The only way I could get her back into school was urging her to trust me that it wouldn’t happen again. Not that I could be certain of this. Two weeks later, another hailstorm came – and she was not prepared – it wasn’t forecast. Hailstones flew through the lobby doors, flooding parts of her school. By the time I arrived, she was pacing, stressed, screaming for me to ‘save her’. She had vomited in the bin and genuinely thought she would die. School staff tried to help by offering umbrellas and ear defenders, but when she shuts down, nothing helps. What also made matters worse was that, the day before, she was told that the weather was ‘not going to get any better’ by a teacher. I understood it was likely an off-the-cuff comment, maybe made with the intention of toughening her up, but they clearly had no knowledge of how severe her anxiety is. Instead it only belittled a fear that has blighted her entire childhood and has had a catastrophic effect on her ability to rationalise, to be optimistic and to put her trust in a system that I think may well be too black and white to ever accommodate her. It’s been three weeks since then and in that time she has only been back to school twice. I believe she has PTSD from being in that lobby, because the worst of all her fears trapped her there – without me. Now she looks at the grey sky every morning and asks me if it’s the same grey sky as it was on that day. Or she’ll ask me why I sent her in, would I have if we knew, will I get there quicker if it happens again? It leaves me feeling wretched. When we sought help from our GP, we were told she’d grow out of it, but as her fears have deepened since, we knew we had to do more. We’ve paid for private counselling for the last five years, we have tried hypnotherapy and herbalists, exposure therapy and EMDR. I’ve even written to celebrity therapists, the Speakmans. Twice. My heart is ragged and I’m exhausted, but I still feel like I’ve not done enough. I didn’t see how bad it was getting until it was too late. I wish I’d tackled it earlier, pushed her in front of medical professionals, and got her on the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) NHS waiting list sooner. I’m worried now more than ever – scientists at the Met Office have found that rainfall associated with storms is becoming both more intense and more likely. There is an increased amount of rainfall, making them about 20% more severe. For families like ours, that’s alarming. We prepare our house like you’d prepare for a disaster: curtains drawn, TV volume up, buckets on standby. While we are still trying to understand and manage Poppy’s condition, we need others to recognise that, for some, weather isn’t just an inconvenience, it’s a source of genuine terror. Don’t dismiss it as a ‘fuss’ or tell us she’ll grow out of it. Understand that her fear is real and debilitating – listen to her. There’s nothing more frustrating than when you’re deep in a fear and no one will take you seriously.

We weather watch, miss chunks of school and turn down invites. I worry that her friends will stop reaching out, that they’ll give up on her. And I miss hearing about her day – we are never apart so there is nothing for her to tell me. For now, we’re looking into homeschooling Poppy, which was something we never wanted to do. I believe school is much more than lessons and learning – Poppy is funny, and kind and so sociable that confining her to our home feels as wrong as caging a bird. But when we have to battle every day to get her out of the house, isn’t that when we have to admit defeat? We have to allow her to finally feel safe and as her mother, I will do anything to protect her. Do you have a story you’d like to share? Get in touch by emailing jess.austin@metro.co.uk.

My dad was told he’d never play sport then led Great Britain to victory in 1972,,"Oct 26, 2024, 3:00pm",,"Home,Lifestyle,Families","My dad, Clive Sullivan, was always terrified of heights. He hated going up ladders to fix the guttering, or anything like that. He really couldn’t bear it. Then, one day when I was around 10, he mentioned he’d been in the army as a paratrooper. ‘But Dad… you’re scared of heights!’, I said, bewildered. ‘I know,’ he said. ‘That’s why I joined the paratroopers – to try and cure my fear.’ That sums up exactly who my dad was. He was determined never to let fear get the better of him, or let anything stop him. He was resilient, tough and brave. My dad wasn’t in the paratroopers for very long – not because of his fear of heights, but because he went on to become a world-class rugby player. My father, Clive Sullivan, has been described as a ‘Welsh rugby league legend’ and as ‘one of Hull’s greatest sporting heroes’, playing for both Hull FC and Hull Kingston Rovers, as well as internationally. In 1972, he captained Great Britain – making him the first Black athlete to captain a British national team. Of course, that’s a phenomenal achievement. But for me, the achievement is in being captain of a rugby team, in and of itself. And not just any rugby team; that year, Britain won the 1972 Rugby League World Cup. For me, the fact that he was captain of a World Cup-winning team speaks more about him than anything else. My dad was born in 1943 in Splott, a suburb of Cardiff, and it wasn’t likely from the outset that he’d become a rugby player. My mother informs me that, as a young boy, he had some form of muscle disease that was never fully diagnosed. He had to spend some time with his legs in plaster and was told that he would never play any sport. It was uncertain whether he’d even be able to walk too well, let alone run. But he joined the army in 1961, after he left school. While he was based with the army in Yorkshire, he was told to play in an army rugby match – my understanding is, they said something along the lines of: Because he was Welsh, he ‘must’ play rugby. And that was how it all began. He played brilliantly – and he realised that, against the odds, he could play rugby; hopefully professionally. He went to a trial at Bradford Northern. They said no; but he then had a trial at Hull, who signed him. After he left the army in 1964, his career went from strength to strength – with him becoming Hull FC’s leading try-scorer and being famous for his incredible speed. He started playing internationally in 1967 and played three World Cup matches in 1968. Then, in 1972, he captained Great Britain. Strangely enough, I don’t remember him speaking too much about that at the time – but then, I would have only been four. But he was a very proud Welshman. He had such pride in his heritage, and in his country – so I can only imagine how proud and pleased he must have been to captain his country in a World Cup; and then, for his team to go on to win. He joined Hull Kingston Rovers in 1974, and one particular memory I have is of the 1980 Challenge Cup Final, where Dad played for Hull KR against Hull FC. I would have been about 11 – it meant so much to me to go to Wembley to watch, not only as a supporter of Hull KR but as Clive Sullivan’s son. I remember how nervous Dad was in the buildup, and what a big deal it was to him. He’d always wanted to play the Challenge Cup Final, and he’d started to think he may never do it. Hull KR won and Dad even went on to play in another Challenge Cup Final in 1982. It was success after success; but I’ve been told, by his ex-teammates, opponents and people who knew him, that not only was he a great rugby player, he was also a great man. That he had time for people, he was always friendly, and he was a great teammate. Hearing that makes me prouder than any number of career highlights. And for me, Dad was just that: My dad. We used to go and watch him play rugby, but this public character who grew out of his myriad achievements isn’t something I ever really identified with him; at least until recent years, when there’s been increasing recognition of everything he accomplished. October marks Black History Month, which reflects on the achievements, cultures and contributions of Black people in the UK and across the globe, as well as educating others about the diverse history of those from African and Caribbean descent. For more information about the events and celebrations that are taking place this year, visit the official Black History Month website.   With my dad working full-time, playing rugby on the weekends, we didn’t get to see him that much; and he died when we were relatively young. There’s still so much I don’t know about him. I do remember, though, that he would never let me win. Whether it was football in the back garden, play wrestling, cards, Monopoly, Scrabble – Dad was very, very competitive. Whether I ever actually won or not, I can’t remember; but I know it was always a struggle to beat him. And what I learned from that – from him – was: If you’re going to do something, you do it to the best of your ability. And you keep trying until that’s the case. This idea of striving to do well, and striving to improve, is something I took with me into my own career. I was an international rugby player myself – but my dad never saw me play. He was diagnosed with cancer in 1985, when I was 16. It was all so sudden – he’d only just stopped playing professionally, and he was still coaching, so he was still relatively fit at the time. It was such a shock. The effect both the disease and the treatment had on him, watching him fade before our eyes, is something I’ll never forget. He passed away just months after his diagnosis, age 42. Looking back, it was like a click of the fingers. The aftermath of his death was incredibly difficult for me. Not only had I lost my father, but it was all far too public. I understand people wanted to express their grief, and the level of public interest shows the level of high esteem he was held in by supporters of Hull FC and Hull KR, the rugby league community, and the city of Hull. I don’t have any resentment for that. But I’m quite shy, and not as social as my father – and I wanted to be left to deal with my grief myself, in my own way. And I just didn’t feel we could do that. Now, I’m fine with the fact that he didn’t see me play – but I still wish I could have had the chance to have had conversations with him about the experience of playing rugby professionally and internationally. Growing up, I played soccer and did athletics. It wasn’t until a friend of my father’s asked if I wanted to play rugby, when I was around 15 that I started following in my dad’s footsteps. I imagine having my father’s name to live up to spurred me on a little. I played at the same club, Hull KR, in the same position – on the wing. So there were always going to be comparisons. He cast a long shadow – but I was simultaneously glad that, when I played, it made people remember my dad and his abilities. Gradually, my attitude matured from feeling as though I was in a battle with my father’s legacy to being one of acceptance. I started to think: ‘I’m my own player, and I do my own thing. And if you want to remember the things my dad achieved because I’m on the field, then I’m perfectly happy with that’. Dad has since been commemorated in so many wonderful ways. The A63 road in Hull was renamed Clive Sullivan Way; and he was one of six inaugural members to be inducted into Hull FC’s Hall of Fame in 1993. Then, in 2022, he joined the British Rugby League Hall of Fame. That was such a special evening for me. The history of rugby is within that Hall of Fame. Not only was it a milestone for my father’s legacy; it meant so much to me, as someone who was ‘in’ the rugby world, to be there and witness it. I understood the gravitas of what this honour meant for my dad. My father left a huge legacy and he was certainly a pioneer. Pro-life mum of seven insists on going ahead with ectopic pregnancy I fell in love after 15 minutes and he hadn't said a word I asked my partner to plan a date night - his idea of romance left me shocked My daughter got caught in a hailstorm and it changed her forever But nobody who comes up to me, when they speak about my father, mentions the colour of his skin. They mention his character, and how he had time for people. They tell me how friendly he was, how he was a wonderful teammate and a great team leader, captaining Great Britain to victory. Who you are; how you behave; how you act; this is what we should all ultimately hold in esteem. I believe that being a genuinely good person, and striving to always be that, are examples for all. This is what people always bring up in connection with my father; and if anything is his legacy, it should be that.

I know my disability makes me a better parent,Dayna Latham,"Oct 26, 2024, 2:00pm",,"Home,Lifestyle,Families","When we first found out I was pregnant in 2022, I was tempted to go into full panic mode. I was elated, but I also knew my health and finances were already hanging on by a thread. So my partner and I sat down and plotted. The only reason I knew I’d make it through in one piece was because of the confidence and ability to stay calm during a crisis that disability has instilled in me. This skill, of course, transfers rather nicely into parenthood. This is just one example of how I believe my disabilities make me a better parent. Don’t get me wrong: There absolutely are days where I feel my disabilities hold me back. Days I feel deep, all consuming guilt for not being able to parent ‘like other mums’. But I’ve recently realised that navigating disability has greatly improved five skills that I’ve found integral to parenthood: resourcefulness, gratitude, patience, budgeting and self-confidence. I have hyper-mobile Ehlers Danlos syndrome (hEDS), spina bifida, scoliosis and endometriosis. I also have diagnoses of borderline personality disorder (BPD), ADHD and complex PTSD. In oversimplified terms, this means my joints are painful and prone to dislocate, and my spine is incredibly wonky and sore. I have near-constant pelvic pain and really rough periods. My health was supposed to make conceiving, carrying and caring for a child much harder than it has, with my medical team warning me throughout my 20s that I was likely infertile, which I spent years trying to come to terms with. So our daughter, Dalia, was a surprise pregnancy – born on July 19, 2023. I struggled greatly throughout my pregnancy – with every single health issue I have flaring worse than ever before. I also had to have a planned C-section due to my spinal issues. I’m grateful to have the support of my partner, Tim – my child’s non-disabled father – as well as a large support system of family living nearby. Now, through a lot of trial and error, there are some important realisations that I’d like to share – all about how I believe my disabilities make me a better parent. For starters, I’m resourceful and resilient, which is easily the one that other people notice the most. This means that I can do a lot with very little, and I’m great at problem-solving because I’ve simply had no choice. The reason I freelance as a writer is precisely this. It’s a rare job that can be done from home, flexibly, with only a laptop and the internet, and without the unsustainable pressure that shift work would put on my body. This has helped me as a mum greatly, as I can get work done before she even wakes up. Secondly, I’ve built up gratitude over the years, especially as most of the fears my medical team had for my parenting journey haven’t come to pass. This gratefulness really enables me to push through the days where everything seems to be going wrong – the days where Dalia is in a foul mood, refuses to stick to her sleep schedule, eat her meals or stop crying. The days where teething feels like a black hole we’ll never escape from. I remind myself how hard fought-for these moments really were and how I never thought I’d have the honour of struggling through them. Then there’s patience. This third skill means that if I don’t pace myself while doing even the most mundane of daily tasks, there are huge consequences – such as drastically increased pain and fatigue, migraines, and burnouts that can render me incapacitated for weeks sometimes. Patience and restraint has made me much more able to deal with toddler meltdowns and chaotic sleep schedules. Self-confidence and self-worth combined are the fourth skills that make me a better mum. My disabilities have rendered me bed bound for huge swathes of my life, and this surplus of time and lack of stimulation has made me ruminate so much, scrutinising every aspect of myself, tearing down and rebuilding them time and time again. My self-worth used to be so tied to my productivity and independence, and I’ve had to reframe this entirely as they both slipped. Years of fighting back against negative self-talk will prove invaluable once my child is old enough to start grappling with these concepts herself. And lastly, there’s my budgeting skills. Disability is very expensive and benefits are very low – I get roughly the same amount as a student loan each year (around £550 a month) – in disability benefit PIP and live purely on this and when I’m unable to write. Tim only works part-time and so helps with bills, but his budget doesn’t go much further either. This has made me very good at stretching a budget well beyond what is typically considered reasonable. Let’s be clear, I’m not saying these skills are unique to disabled people – or apply to all of us – but disability has definitely heightened them for me personally. People without first-hand experience often don’t realise how much skill navigating disability actually requires – and that’s before factoring in things like relentless medical advocacy (advocating for yourself in medical settings, especially when doctors are reluctant to treat you or accept that you require further help) or the complex, often brutal workings of our benefits system. In fact, often people seem surprised that I wanted children at all due to my health issues or that I’d be too scared of passing my genes on. These assumptions of childlessness even extended to some of my doctors.

Having a baby as a disabled woman has been the most rewarding, humbling and hardest thing I’ve ever done. As cliche as it sounds, I’m still learning so much more every day. But I’ve never felt this thankful for or proud of my disabilities and what they’ve taught me over the years. That’s why I’m choosing to see those five key things as what makes me the best mum I can be. Do you have a story you’d like to share? Get in touch by emailing jess.austin@metro.co.uk.

I asked my partner to plan a date night – his idea of romance left me shocked,Hannah Wilkinson,"Oct 26, 2024, 12:00pm",,"Home,Lifestyle","‘You’re never going to guess what I’ve got planned for tonight,’ my partner, Bren, told me, grinning like a Cheshire cat. It was July 2024, and he had been teasing me with this statement for weeks. Each time I’d hazard a guess but would get no closer to deciphering the surprise. I started to imagine the unthinkable: that he’d signed me up for a Tough Mudder. Or, like that poor woman on Don’t Tell the Bride, he’d booked a skydive and bungee jump before we declared our love to one another. At the start of the year, I suggested we reinstate weekly date nights because food-shopping trips to Lidl had become our only recurring outing. Having experienced several relationships that ended due to a lack of romance, I wanted to ensure we kept the same flame burning that had been ignited on a sticky dance floor in a Soho salsa club over a year ago. He agreed and we’ve since taken turns to plan new dating experiences – some surprises, and some mutually organised. We’ve enjoyed late-night Japanese dinners and at-home movie marathons, with highlights including a sunset picnic on a scenic clifftop and a spa night away. But all of these memories were about to be trumped. ‘What do I need to wear tonight?’ I asked that night while throwing back a Paracetamol – still recovering from a week-long cold.

TONIGHT: THE OGRETONES. THE UK’S #1 SHREK TRIBUTE BAND. My mouth was agape. I was as shocked as I was when I learned Pinocchio had a penchant for wearing ladies’ underwear. I’d never heard of a tribute band that specialised in the back catalogue of the greatest movie franchise of all time. With the amount of medicine in my system I questioned if this could all be a fever dream – I reached out to touch the poster just as a man walked past wearing protruding green ears. Nope. This was real life. I’ve always used Shrek as an emotional support tool. Whether sick, sad or overwhelmed by the choice of what to watch on Netflix, I’ll stick Shrek on knowing that for the next hour and a half, all of my troubles are but a distant memory. Perhaps it’s childhood nostalgia, the perfect casting, innuendo-laden humour – or a combination of all those things that keeps me returning for more. My partner learned of my love for Shrek early in our relationship when we spent a weekend watching each other’s favourite films. He embraced Shrek as much as his beloved Back to the Future franchise, so he was just as excited as me to find out what tonight’s event had in store. We headed straight to the bar where an ‘Ogretini’ was the beverage du jour, but having not drunk Midori since I was a sixteen-year-old stealing spirits from parent’s cupboards, we kept it safe and settled on a Guinness. Drinks in hand, we took our place towards the front of the stage alongside fellow millennials who looked just as bewildered by what could be in store for us. But all nerves dissipated once the band made their way to the stage. Three method-acting Blind Mice and a Big Bad Wolf wearing grandma’s nightie took their place alongside their fellow fairytale characters to unleash Smash Mouth’s All Star. ‘This is the best night ever,’ I laughed. ‘I can’t believe you found this!’ I said as we frolicked along to an awe-inspiring rendition of Live and Let Die. As suprise date nights go… this was up there with the best of them. @The Ogretones  #shrekisloveshrekislife #millenialsontiktok #datenightidea An electric set list and two encores later, we arrived home with hoarse voices from all the singing but with our hearts very much full. The morning after our date, I posted a b-roll of the evening to TikTok intending to give friends and family a giggle. I didn’t expect to open my phone a few hours later and see that over 100,000 people had watched it. I fell in love after 15 minutes and he hadn't said a word My daughter got caught in a hailstorm and it changed her forever ‘Talk dirty to me,’ I said - then my lover went quiet There's a phrase that people hate even more than 'live, laugh, love' As the week went on, we watched in astonishment as the video slowly started to creep to over one and a half million views, with comments like: ‘Shrek is love, Shrek is life,’. ‘Ideal dream date, never leave this man!!’ and ‘This is brilliant! Book them for your future wedding.’ I never thought we’d be the kind of couple to open our relationship up, but I’m pleased to report that a night with a green ogre and his band of enchanted misfits has helped keep the romance well and truly alive. We’ve long found that relationships require thoughtfulness, fun, and a willingness to embrace the unexpected. Since that night, we’ve committed to prioritising each other more than ever – and in my eyes, that’ll do Donkey, that’ll do.

How I ended up on a weekend break in a warzone… and why I’d love to go back,Angela Kennedy,"Oct 26, 2024, 10:00am",,"Home,News,World","Standing in the centre of the city, I felt the buzz of this beautiful old cosmopolitan hub. Bustling cafes, fine restaurants, grand hotels, chic bars and boutiques. Locals exuded enviable street-style cool. Was I in Prague, Paris, Barcelona? No, I was on a weekend break in L’viv, Ukraine – a nation experiencing the bombs and bullets of a brutal invasion. It began, as many crazy ideas do, with an invitation from a total stranger on social media. Ukrainian journalist, Maria Romanenko, tweeted a shout-out to join a trip to L’viv. I was tempted. Part of my family is from L’viv region – so I wanted to make a personal journey to my grandfather’s birthplace. But that was out of the question with the full-scale invasion by Russia. Now, with the safety-cushion of a group and the help of a native speaker, it seemed like a possibility. Of course, a holiday in a warzone wasn’t the most sensible idea I’d ever had. The UK government advises against all but essential travel to western parts of Ukraine, including L’viv. But the decision was made and the countdown was on. I didn’t tell my parents for fear they’d worry. Added to the aptly named, L’viving La Vida Loca, WhatsApp group, I contacted my fellow travellers. A lovely, lively bunch. Nine of us were travelling from the UK, four women and five men from very different backgrounds, aged from twenties to fifties. We prepared by downloading air raid alarm apps onto our phones, as advised by Maria’s partner, Jez – the mastermind behind our travel logistics. A sobering reminder we’d be in a country under attack. The mood lightened when group member Phil posted: “Downloaded the air raid app yesterday and it made me incredibly popular at home when it went off at 3am last night!” Gearing up to go, I booked my flight to Poland. I packed a mini-portable powerbank for phone charging to keep in touch with the group. Sadly, power cuts are frequent as Russia bombs energy infrastructure to make daily life difficult for civilians. Excitement was growing – but on September 4, ten days before departure, Russia bombed L’viv, destroying residential buildings with missiles. Seven people were killed and 66 wounded. Heartbreakingly, mother Eugenia, 43 and her daughters Yaryna, 21, Daryna, 18, and Emilia, 7, were killed. Father, Yaroslav, narrowly survived – his family annihilated in one terrible moment. Shock, anger and disgust rattled around our group at these senseless murders of innocents. Another emotion was fear. What on earth were we doing? One person dropped out, but happily soon rejoined after calming his family’s understandable fears. I briefly considered not going. But it was unlikely another attack would happen so soon in this region hundreds of kilometres from the frontlines. In a weird way I felt even more determined to show my support by visiting. On a chilly September morning, my husband and I bundled ourselves into a 5am taxi to Stansted airport. Maria and Jez’s tried and tested route is flying to Rzeszów in Poland, then taking the Lev bus directly to L’viv. We met Phil in the airport café. The rest of our group were on the Manchester flight. Meeting the group was a buzz. I was surprised by how fast and efficient the bus border crossing was – we may have been lucky. The Ukrainian border guard looked delighted and amused at us Brits on a sightseeing trip to Ukraine. Crossing the border, a bundle of Ukrainian flags intermixed with EU flags fluttered in the breeze – symbol of future hope. Arriving, we split to settle into our hotels – many now with air raid shelters. I stayed at the centrally located George Hotel, a gorgeous old building with a pink and white Art Nouveau-style façade. Standing on our amazingly long private balcony overlooking downtown L’viv, solemn music began playing outside. I saw a procession of black cars with people stopping to show respect. A funeral procession for three fallen defenders had been held that day, I later discovered. In the evening, we were going for dinner at Choven, a gastro-pub with a sprawling range of craft beers. But the place was rammed, so we couldn’t get a table. It was heartening to see Ukrainians trying to live as normally as possible despite the horrors of invasion, just as Brits did during the Blitz. Instead, we went to Chiberechna, a Crimean Tatar restaurant specialising in chebureki savoury fried pancakes filled with meat, veggies or cheese. I opted for the yantiq pancakes – grilled instead of fried – stuffed with lamb, onion, coriander. Delicious! A post shared by Чіберечна від Селям (@chiberechna) Sipping on a glass of Odesa Black – a rich cherry, chocolatey red wine – I chatted to Anca, a Romanian citizen who joined us for dinner. Fresh from finishing a Master’s Degree at Liverpool University, she was spending five weeks at L’viv Volunteer Kitchen helping peel, slice and dehydrate vegetables for meals for frontline soldiers. She also volunteered to weave nets to protect troops in the trenches. Anca pointed out that safety is relative, saying: ‘As a woman, I feel safer in L’viv than in parts of London or Liverpool. There are many risks [in life] some closer to home.’ I couldn’t agree more. Three men in military uniform were eating heartily and drinking shots, with Ukrainian cheers of ‘budmo!’ Everyone fell silent as the tough-looking men belted out an uplifting song in perfect three-part harmony! Diners applauded as the waitress brought a birthday cake for one of them. I wondered who those men were before the invasion began – and whether they would survive. Our group dispersed at 11.30pm, exhausted from travelling but that wasn’t the reason. L’viv has a curfew due to the Russian invasion. In L’viv, it’s 12am until 5am. Everybody must be off the streets. We hurried through the rapidly emptying city – distracted by brightly lit boutique window displays of handmade jewellery, bags and clothes. I was nervous on the first night – expecting an air raid siren. We had warm clothes and documents ready to flee to a shelter. Thankfully, we didn’t need them. As morning rain turned to sunshine, we gathered for a walking tour, led by L’viv local, Diana, who showed us an array of amazing sights including awe-inspiring churches, one with Christening guests wearing traditional vyshyvanka embroidered shirts. We saw captivating street art, the fascinating Armenian quarter, and rows of beautiful old buildings – from Art Nouveau and Art deco to Gothic flourishes – some obscured by sandbags and scaffolding to protect from bomb blasts. A trumpeter belted out a patriotic tune from the balcony of a government building. Outside the Dzyga Arts Centre, we met brightly dressed couple Alex and Nathalia. Alex said he was a hippy in L’viv when it was part of the USSR – his lifestyle frowned on by anti-western authorities. He loved listening to bands such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin, even though he couldn’t understand the words. We finished at the spectacular L’viv opera house. People were queuing to register for the Sunday morning run around the city – a bit like Parkrun. Maria was taking part too. As the group headed for lunch at Cantona Pub – a Manchester United-themed bar, I set off on a mission of my own. To my grandfather’s village of Zvenyhorod. An impressive golden-domed church stood on the outskirts. Further on, a public square with a stream and monumental Viking-like statues, created in the Eighties to mark the village’s 900th anniversary. A statue of Ukrainian national poet, Taras Shevchenko, stood outside the museum. I found Shevchenko poems among my grandfather’s most treasured possessions. Inside the museum the ladies on the front desk were delightful. I’d brought flowers to put on the grave of my great-grandmother but didn’t know where to search. So, I presented them to the lovely museum ladies. I’d sent a Google-translated DM to Zvenyhorod Facebook page before our visit. But I didn’t hear back. However, when I showed the message, the women excitedly brandished their own printed copy – I was amazed. Unfortunately, I couldn’t speak Ukrainian, so we couldn’t communicate. The museum was full of fascinating local artefacts such as jewellery, traditional embroideries and stained-glass windows. Virtual reality tech allows you to ‘walk around’ old Zvenyhorod, which was once a grand principality – I’d love to try it next time. The ever-helpful ladies collared two English-speaking Ukrainians. They told me the town archivist was searching for my family. I was moved they went to such trouble for a stranger. I thanked them and bought items from their shop – a lovely hand-embroidered bag. I wanted to explore further, but our taxi was waiting. Hopping over to the next village for Gryniv Music Festival, rain began pounding down but I felt dizzily elated. Arriving to catch ДикоBrass, a brass funk ensemble so good people were dancing in the pouring rain, we found fellow festival-goers Maria, Ollie and Ash. The rest of our group remained in L’viv for a football match: Shakhtar Donetsk versus Karpaty L’viv. We stayed dry under large awnings, watching NAZVA, a young folky-poppy duo, but the final act blew us away. As if by magic, rain stopped and all-female folk-rock band, Yagody, stole our souls for an hour – there was something electric in the atmosphere. On our final day, we visited Unbroken, a rehabilitation centre for victims of Russian violence, such as bomb blast injuries. More than 15,000 Ukrainians, including 2,000 children, have been treated there, says its website. Unbroken offers reconstructive surgery, orthopaedics, prosthetics, physical and psychological rehabilitation. Communications director, Julie, showed us around with passion and enthusiasm that was contagious. We met amputee soldier, Artem, whose mental strength was humbling. ‘No matter what they [Russians] do, we will keep coming back,’ he said. We met Vadim, a Marine, recuperating but keen to return to the frontlines. Finding out we were British, Artem quipped: ‘Say hello to Prince Harry for me!’ Seeing rehabilitation rooms for children who’d lost limbs in Russian bombings was incredibly sad. We met a severely injured man in his hospital bed who told us of horrific experiences. But far from sad stories this was the testimony of survivors, each determined to have a fulfilling future. Moment Putin is left absolutely seething at BBC reporter over question about Ukraine Astronaut returns from space with mystery medical condition Inside the radioactive island with mutant sharks that was used to test nuclear bombs World's 'oldest pyramid' may actually be 25,000 years old Unbroken needs funding for equipment – you can donate. As Maria said: ‘Ukrainian soldiers have given up their lives, limbs, careers and family life to protect us all. We must ensure Ukraine wins soon. But it’s not just about Ukraine – it’s about future peace for the world.’ Returning to the city, I walked to Ivan Franko National University of Lviv, where my grandfather was once a student. Soldiers sat on benches talking animatedly, while old men played board games. By Taras Shevchenko statue, a group of older people gathered to sing. A man in military uniform hoisted a delighted little boy on his shoulders. That night, our farewell dinner was at the achingly cool Cloud no. 7 Panorama with rooftop bar, before catching the train from L’viv to Przemyśl in Poland. The train is a quicker route back than the coach. The crossing was smooth and efficient. Soon we were on our flight home – which had Ukrainian football hero Andriy Shevchenko on board! The following morning, my air raid siren app went off. L’viv was under threat. I thought about all the people I’d seen there and hoped they would be safe.

Met Office gives verdict on if it will snow this week,Gethin Hicks and Danny Rigg,"Oct 26, 2024, 9:08am","Oct 26, 2024, 9:38am","Home,News,UK","Some of Britain could see snow as early as next week, according to the Met Office’s long range forecast. Snow does not usually fall in the United Kingdom until the turn of the year, but it could come early this year. Temperatures are predicted to plummet to freezing in the coming weeks, with the possibility of snowfall in the next few days. So just where is snow expected to fall in the UK across the coming days? Don’t get too excited for a snow fight just yet, as it’s going to be limited to areas like Inverness in the north and east of Scotland. That’s if there’s any snow at all, which may be hard to imagine after temperatures up to the high teens in parts of the UK this week. From October 30 to November 8, the Met Office predicts: ‘The period is likely to be characterised by often quiet and settled weather, as an area of high pressure becomes the dominant feature of the weather. ‘Some mist and fog is probable in the south at first, alongside rather cloudy conditions, whilst in the extreme north spells of stronger winds and rain could brush past giving a slightly more unsettled picture. ‘Into the start of November, there is a chance the weather could (briefly) turn much colder/brighter, with a chance of snow showers in northern and eastern areas, but it’s equally possible these could stay clear of the UK, or the milder conditions could remain in place.

But the Met Office warned ‘headlines don’t always reflect the reality’. Clarifying the snow forecast, it said: ‘Any snow will likely be confined to high ground in the north, as is normal for the time of year.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

Championship match put on hold as mystery individual is spotted flying over stadium,Tom Olver,"Oct 26, 2024, 3:12pm","Oct 26, 2024, 3:31pm","Home,Sport,Football","Coventry City’s clash with Luton Town was temporarily put on hold after an individual was spotted flying over the stadium in the closing stages of the thrilling Championship clash. Haji Wright scrambled home a last-gasp winner as Mark Robins’ hosts came from two goals down to secure a 3-2 victory but a paragliding daredevil briefly took centre stage in the West Midlands. Loud cheers and whistles were heard around the stadium as the person in question hovered over the pitch with around ten minutes remaining of normal time at the Coventry Building Society Arena. The match had to be paused as the mystery individual drifted over the stands and out of the view from Sky Sports’ cameras, before referee Bobby Madley blew his whistle to signal for play to be resumed. Coventry had picked up just two wins prior to their victory over Luton and the result ensured Robins’ men leapfrogged their visitors into 19th place in the table. Luton, meanwhile, find themselves stranded down in 19th place following the defeat and could be sucked into the drop zone should results go against them this weekend. Rob Edwards’ side have accumulated just 12 points in the division after suffering relegation from the Premier League last season. Dude casually flying over the match between Coventry vs Luton FC #covlut pic.twitter.com/do0QlzVwmo ‘I don’t really care how they come as long as they go in,’ Coventry forward Wright told Sky Sports when asked about his scruffy winning goal. ‘It was an important goal for us, we were working throughout the 90 minutes to get a goal like this and for it to happen this way is amazing. ‘I think our play in the first half gave us a bit of confidence. ‘We knew we were creating chances and it was just a matter of time before we took one.’ After a tough start to the 2024/25 campaign, Wright is confident Coventry are beginning to ‘gel’ and find their feet. ‘It’s frustrating. We still have loads of new players and our team is quite young so we’re still trying to find that gel and the perfect tempo to play with,’ he added. ‘We’re still finding our feet a bit but today was a great day for us.’ How Arsenal academy stars reacted to Jack Wilshere's Norwich departure Former Premier League footballer, 24, arrested over rape of woman in London hotel Sheffield United pay moving tribute to former player George Baldock before Leeds clash Chris Wilder 'stunned and numb' after tragic death of footballer George Baldock A downbeat Edwards criticised Luton’s poor defending in the match but took full responsibility for the manner of his team’s loss. ‘There were too many moments where we were open, gave them that glimmer from a set-piece. It’s on us, it’s on me,’ the Luton head coach said shortly after the final whistle. ‘It’s 2-1 and then the crowd really get behind them, more intensity. We tried to introduce changes early to have an impact but in the end we haven’t defended well enough. ‘I’ll completely own it.

								video A home burst into flames after fireworks were hurled into a garden by a bunch of youths. The large blaze quickly spread on Whittle Grove, Bolton, on October 19, while a family were sitting inside watching TV. Police and the fire and rescue service were called to the scene following reports of anti-social behaviour. A dad, who wished to remain anonymous, described how his family had been left petrified by the attack. He said: ‘I was watching telly in the living room and one of our neighbours came banging on our door.. ‘He said “your back garden’s on fire”. I turned around barefoot and ran to the back, the flames were as high as the house. ‘I got a hosepipe and started hosing the fire before the fire brigade got there. It was like an inferno, our next door neighbour’s garden went up as well. ‘It’s outrageous what an accident can cause. I was sat there watching Saturday night telly with a beer. It was scary, and we shouldn’t have to live like that.’ He posted a video of the youths to social media in a bid to highlight the dangers of fireworks.

Developer wants to cram 56 people into London house with one shared kitchen,Brooke Davies,"Oct 26, 2024, 2:21pm",,"Home,News,UK","A property developer has applied to transform an east London townhouse to fit up to 56 people with just one shared kitchen. Dilawar Properties applied to Newham Council to turn the Victorian building on Romford Road in Forest Gate into a ‘co living space’. The application said it would create 28-units with each room including a double bed, kitchenette and ensuite shower room plus toilet. Developers also want to build a communal games room and a reception for residents. But despite their promises, the council’s Local Development Committee were recommended to not approve the application due to the ‘poor quality’ of rooms offered. The size of each bedroom ranges from 14.7m2 to 22.3m2, which goes against London Plan guidance for ‘large-scale, purpose-built, shared living’. Planning officers said they were concerned the small sizes would be detrimental to residents’ long-term health, and several of the rooms would not receive enough sunlight throughout the year. The shared kitchen’s size of 12.3m2 also falls well below set standards, with east London HMO Guidance saying the kitchen would need to be at least 57.5m2.

The planning committee said: ‘The proposed development would give rise to a poor standard of accommodation to the detriment of future occupiers by reason of the failure to provide sufficiently sized internal and external communal areas. ‘The proposal would contradict the large-scale shared living guidance and give rise to restrictive and isolating living conditions to the detriment of the health and wellbeing of future occupants.’ To get the latest news from the capital visit Metro.co.uk's London news hub.

Donald Trump throws shade at Beyoncé for championing Kamala Harris ahead of election,Robert Oliver,"Oct 26, 2024, 12:46pm","Oct 26, 2024, 12:52pm","Home,Entertainment,Showbiz","Donald Trump took a moment out of his most recent rally to throw shade at Beyoncé after she attended an event for Vice President Kamala Harris. Former President and Republican Presidential candidate Trump, 78, was on stage in Traverse City, Michigan on Friday when he spoke about his opponents in the election race. First referring to current President Joe Biden, 81, Trump said: ‘Joe Biden is asleep,’ before turning his attention towards Vice President Harris and Beyoncé. ‘Kamala Harris is at a dance party with Beyoncé,’ he said in a mocking tone of voice, donning a black baseball cap with the words ‘Make America Great Again’ emblazoned on the front. Parts of the crowd booed loudly at the immediate mention of Harris’ name, with the 2024 Presidential election just 12 days away. Harris, 60, meanwhile, spoke in front of an estimated 30,000 people in Houston, Texas, with the Single Ladies hitmaker, 43, also taking the stand.

								video While Beyoncé didn’t perform a song, as she did in 2016 as part of Hillary Clinton’s campaign, she had prepared a speech of her own. ‘I’m not here as a celebrity; I’m not here as a politician. I’m here as a mother,’ she began, claiming that a Republican government would reduce women’s rights. She continued: ‘A mother who cares deeply about the world my children and all of our children live in, a world where we have the freedom to control our bodies, a world where we’re not divided. ‘Imagine our daughters growing up seeing what’s possible with no ceilings, no limitations. We must vote, and we need you.’ The rally taking place in Houston was crucial to the message of Beyoncé’s speech, with the state imposing a strict ban on abortion in September 2021, almost a year before Roe v. Wade was overturned. Harris came to the stage after Beyoncé and warned voters that abortion rights in several states could be under threat in the near future. ‘For anyone watching from another state, if you think you are protected from Trump abortion bans because you live in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, New York, California, or any state where voters or legislators have protected reproductive freedom, please know: No one is protected.’ Beyoncé, who introduced Harris as ‘the next President of the United States’, was also joined on stage by her former Destiny’s Child bandmate Kelly Rowland. Before speaking in the Crazy In Love singer’s home city of Houston on Friday, Harris has been using Beyoncé’s song Freedom as part of her campaign since first playing it in July.

Woman blinded by parasites after making mistake with her contact lenses,Brooke Davies,"Oct 26, 2024, 11:18am","Oct 26, 2024, 2:56pm","Home,News,US","A woman has been left blind in her right eye after parasites burrowed into her cornea while swimming with contact lenses in. Brooklyn McCasland, 23, said she was in the ‘worst pain she’d ever felt’ after going on a beach trip with friends in August. The barista was told by doctors it was just sand in her eye, but the pain went on for weeks. The outer layer of her eye began clouding over, and a specialist found parasites had burrowed into the Brooklyn’s cornea. She said: ‘If I could have avoided all this pain by not swimming in my contacts, then I would have done it.’ Brooklyn, from Texas, has been forced to quit her job as her depth perception has been warped making working in a well-lit café nearly impossible. The parasite, called acanthamoeba, lives in water and enters through microscopic tears in the eye. They are about 5,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. Brooklyn is now waiting for an expensive transplant that only has a small chance of restoring her sight. Doctors thought the pain which ‘felt like glass’ was caused by an infection, but Brooklyn’s vision went blurry several weeks later. She said: ‘They were still just shooting in the dark which was really frustrating. I remember praying.’ After travelling four hours to the specialist, she was diagnosed with acanthamoeba keratosis, MailOnline reports. Brooklyn said: ‘It was a shock but also a relief to have everything answered. ‘For so long being misdiagnosed and not knowing what it is and it getting worse and being in pain.’ Dog dies on flight after being booted from first class to coach Airbnb guest finds 'secret chamber' connected to her apartment People unable to sleep after 'UFO cluster' of orange orbs spotted speeding across sky How the Menendez brothers murder case unfolded after huge new release twist If caught early enough, doctors can prescribe eye drops which can kill the parasites. In around 40% of cases doctors have to perform surgery, which involves scraping the outside of the eye to remove the parasites and repairing the area through transplant.

Jeremy Clarkson reveals ‘horrific’ lifestyle changes after undergoing terrifying urgent heart surgery,Pierra Willix,"Oct 26, 2024, 10:34am",,"Home,Entertainment,TV","Jeremy Clarkson has said he hates his ‘horrific’ new lifestyle after a recent health scare. The former Top Gear presenter, 64, underwent a heart procedure after experiencing a ‘sudden deterioration’ in his health, and was rushed to hospital in an ambulance in recent weeks. After suffering from worrying symptoms including being ‘clammy’, with a ‘tightness in my chest’, and ‘pins and needles in my left arm’, he had a stent fitted after doctors discovered that one of his arteries was ‘completely blocked’. Although he is now recovering, Jeremy has made it clear he’s not happy about advice he’s been given to look after himself going forward. Writing about his ‘extremely urgent surgery’, Jeremy said he wasn’t scared at the time but was now after being told how he ‘must live my life from now on’. ‘Literally, I am not allowed to have fun any more. This is terrifying,’ he said. ‘The worst problem though is diet. To cut my alarmingly high levels of cholesterol, I need to cut out, completely, everything I like eating,’ he explained in his column for The Sun. ‘Bacon, sausages, beef, lamb, pork, butter, chips, proper milk, Cadbury’s fruit and nut bars and the interesting bit in an egg. I’ve had a week now to live in the new regime and it’s horrific. Have you ever tried kale? Well, don’t, because it’s like eating the contents of a AAA battery.’ Then explaining his hatred of Greek yoghurt and almond milk, Jeremy lamented how he has to cut out drinking alcohol and take up exercising. ‘I’ve always seen this is something you do when travelling from the car to the pub, or from the lunch table to the sitting room. But apparently, when I’ve recovered from the operation, I must do more,’ he wrote. Being advised by his doctor to slow down and take up a hobby like golf, Jeremy was not impressed, listing all the commitments he has – including ‘writing three newspaper columns a week, owning a brewery, pub and shop and hosting Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?, plus running a farm and making a television show about that’. Reflecting on how he ‘grabbed the gift of live by the scruff of its neck and went berserk’, the presenter said he had no regrets about ‘never saying no to anything that sounded exciting’. However, after ‘the Grim Reaper poked his nose around the door’, he decided he did ‘quite fancy living a bit longer’. Jeremy Clarkson dealt another blow in 's**t week' after heart attack scare Jeremy Clarkson responds to cruel remarks about health scare Who Wants to Be A Millionaire? player sparks backlash with big mistake that cost £61,000 James May hits back at 'sexist' Top Gear criticism with five-word statement Jeremy then said he would like to see his grandchildren grow up, see a few more sunrises and also visit the Galapagos Islands, which he said would be achievable by ‘living on water, steamed fish, and exercise’. Earlie this week Jeremy thanked followers on social media for their well-wishes and support, but also issued a sharp response about his diet. Replying to a comment which read ‘Now he seems to have had a heart attack, and needed surgery what does he expect eating all that meat? He can’t be surprised!’ the Clarkson’s Farm star said: ‘Better than dying of vegetable induced boredom.’ I sold my £2,000,000 Omaze house — the best thing about it was the lawnmower What I Own: I paid the deposit for my £320,000 Isleworth one-bed by borrowing from my boss The 'beautiful' county where houses are on the market for £35,000 Homes with these 3 features are selling faster than the rest What I Rent: I pay £1,895 for my one-bedroom Battersea flat, but I don't have my own oven Clarkson’s Farm is streaming on Amazon Prime Video.

TV legend ‘set for new chat show from beyond the grave’,Pierra Willix,"Oct 26, 2024, 11:54am",,"Home,Entertainment,TV","A TV legend who died last year is set to ‘continue as the chat show king’ from beyond the grave. Sir Michael Parkinson, whose TV career spanned seven decades, died last year aged 88. Throughout his illustrious career, the broadcaster interviewed some of the most famous people in the world, including Ingrid Bergmann, Fred Astair, Lauren Bacall, Sir Elton John, Muhammad Ali and Meg Ryan, to name a few. He fronted his own BBC chat show Parkinson from 1971 to 1982 and then from 1998 to 2007, with the programme switching to ITV for its final three years. However now there now plans to utilise artificial intelligence to allow him to continue interviewing. The technology ‘will be used to recreate Parky’s distinctive voice as he quizzes famous names for a podcast’. ‘The fact that a bizarre project like this is being pursued is a measure of just how adored Parky was and how missed he now is,’ a source said. ‘Although it sounds strange, using AI like this will keep the memory of the grand inquisitor alive and remember him for doing what he did best — grilling famous people,’ they added when speaking to The Sun. His son Mike Parkinson has given his backing to the project for which a string of potential interview subjects have been identified. The eight-part unscripted series, Virtually Parkinson, will allow new guests to be questioned in Parkinson’s famous relaxed style, with the full backing of his family and estate, as reported by The Guardian. Made by Deep Fusion Films, the podcast is believed to be the first to be entirely presented by an AI host. ‘We’re going for a new generation of guest talent, but that doesn’t mean he would not go back again to people he interviewed before,’ Mike told the publication. ‘Doing this now, trying something so new, we feel a bit like he must have felt back in 1971 when his show started.’ The AI version of Parkinson will be driven by data culled from his back catalogue of hundreds of VIP interviews and will not be an approximation of his voice – it will be his. ‘It’s exactly how he delivered his questions – even the pacing is the same. It stills people when they hear it,’ Mike added. The producers are now in the process of approaching celebrities to take part. One of the broadcasters most memorable interviews was a 2003 chat with actress Meg Ryan. The Hollywood star appeared on Parkinson’s show to promote her critically panned thriller In The Cut but they had a frosty exchange, with Ryan going so far as to tell him to ‘wrap it up’. Sat next to Ryan were Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine, hosts of What Not To Wear. This week Trinny reflected on having a front-row seat for the ‘iconic’ moment. ‘I do remember something very specifically, god rest Mr. Parkinson,’ she said on Nick Grimshaw and Angela Hartnett’s Waitrose podcast Dish.

Trinny backed up Parkinson, blasting Ryan for refusing to respond to simple questions despite being ‘paid millions’ to encourage viewers to watch her movie.

I wish I’d dealt with it in a more courteous manner.’ Got a story?

Airbnb guest finds ‘secret chamber’ connected to her apartment,Jessica Kwong,"Oct 26, 2024, 8:00am","Oct 26, 2024, 8:29am","Home,News,US","An Airbnb guest was filled with fright after discovering a door in her rental led to a hidden chamber. Xena Habashi booked a basement apartment in Chicago through the vacation property rentals company and was shocked to find what she described as a ‘hidden chamber’. ‘Found a room that wasn’t part of the Airbnb listing,’ she captioned a video she posted on TikTok. The clip, with ominous-sounding music in the background, shows a normal looking bedroom and then pans to one of the doors which she opens and exposes a dark, cellar-like room with exposed brick, wood and other items. Part 2, couldnt keep going in because the floor wasnt stable.  One of the rooms floor had a wood that you can lift up and it goes down  to a room#airbnb #part2 Among the items were ‘wooden doors with locks on’ and ‘chains on the ground’, and another door went ‘even further down’ the building, Habashi told Newsweek. Habashi, of Kansas City, Missouri, said she checked in around 4am on December 30, 2023, and intended on going to sleep, but struggled to after making the discovery. ‘I noticed that there were so many random doors inside the house that were never shown in the listing,’ she said. ‘While getting ready to go to sleep me and my cousin noticed a light on in one of the rooms that was locked. We decided to try and open it… I got a fork and was able to open the door. That’s when I saw it.’ Habashi said she and her cousin ran to another room to inform her mother, who ‘got scared too because that was never shown in the listing and it looked scary’. She said they blocked the door using a table but were not able to sleep. ‘We stayed up till the morning, kept hearing noises, and before we left I decided to take that video and it went viral unexpectedly!’ she said.

There were no prior complaints about the listing, which had a 4.84 rating. ‘The listing is advertised as a basement apartment, and the separate space that was accessed is part of the basement,’ an Airbnb spokesperson told Newsweek. ‘Our customer service team supported our guest with their concerns at the time, and assisted with a refund and another place to stay.’ It is not the first time such a discovery has been made.

BBC radio show ‘in chaos’ after hosts ‘fall out over criticising email’,Joel Harley,"Oct 26, 2024, 5:29pm","Oct 26, 2024, 5:30pm","Home,Entertainment,Showbiz","BBC Radio 5 Live has reportedly been left in a state of ‘chaos’ after an alleged fallout between presenters Tony Livesey and Clare McDonnell – over an offensive e-mail intended for someone else. Reports of the pair’s feud comes after Tony, 59, accidentally sent an e-mail to his co-host, criticising her presenting abilities. Tony and Clare, 47, have presented 5Live’s drivetime show together since February 2022 – but haven’t been seen in the studio together since May. Clare is now said to be refusing to work with Tony – and the pair have been alternating their shifts at the station so as to avoid each other. According to a source, their feud has caused ‘chaos’ at the station, and the BBC are reportedly planning to permanently separate the presenters by relegating him back to the late night slot where he was when he originally joined. The change, which is reportedly due to begin in December is a ‘kick in the teeth’ to the journalist and proto-Traitors host, who originally joined the BBC in 2006. ‘She no longer wants to work with him and that has caused total chaos at the station. People are being shifted all over the shop and into different slots, which isn’t going down well,’ a source told The Sun. They continued: ‘Clare is well within her right to be angry — but it’s made the atmosphere at 5 Live really frosty.’ ‘It has become a nightmare there,’ the tabloid’s source continued. Since the event, Tony and Clare have alternated hosting the drivetime slot separately. On Monday and Tuesday, Johnny I’Anso stepped in to host with Clare. Then, on Wednesday and Thursday, Tony presented the show with journalist and political correspondent Leila Nathoo. In December, Tony will move back to the late night slot he first originated in 2010 – and he’s reportedly not happy about it. The newspaper’s source continued: ‘Tony has lost a really good gig because of that message to Clare. It’s a massive kick in the teeth for him. ‘Clare is happy she was listened to by station bosses and thinks Tony has got exactly what he deserves.’ Tony will be replaced by Chris Warburton from December. Chris, who has hosted Weekend Breakfast since 2014, will join Clare as the permanent host of Live Drive. Tensions between the pair first became evident last year after a snippy exchange saw Tony and Clare exchange jabs live on air. This came as Tony praised the ‘professionalism’ of Wimbledon correspondents such as Gigi Salmon, Russell Fuller and David Law, he said: ‘They are uber professional, it’s a privilege to sit alongside them.’ ‘It’ll be good to work alongside professionals, for a change, I’m looking forward to it,’ Clare joked.

Fans delighted as Strictly Come Dancing legend ‘confirms’ shock return,Emily Bashforth,"Oct 26, 2024, 4:02pm","Oct 26, 2024, 4:03pm","Home,Entertainment,TV","One Strictly Come Dancing professional left the BBC show five years ago – but now he’s back. Kevin Clifton joined Strictly in 2013 and remained part of the glittering madness until 2019, having lifted the coveted glitterball grophy with Stacey Dooley in series 16. The dance partners went on to become real-life partners, now sharing young daughter Minnie after getting together shortly after their big win. Kevin, 42, originally announced his departure from Strictly by thanking the show and his fellow pro dancers for ‘inspiring’ him, vowing to leave ‘on a high’ by moving on to a new chapter. However, it seems he still has a lot of love for the programme that catapulted him to household fame, having returned to the studio this week. Last night, the Grimsby-born choreographer took to his Instagram Story with a snap taken inside the studio. He shared the pic to his socials without a caption, leaving Strictly fanatics to wonder what he was up to, having seemingly captured the shot from behind the judges’ table. His post will send fans into a frenzy though, no doubt, as the Strictly viewership has long declared it’s ‘not the same’ now without him. What was clear from the picture, though, was that the wheels are in full motion to prep the studio for Halloween Week, as creepy decorations were displayed around the place. Tonight, the likes of Shayne Ward, Tasha Ghouri, Pete Wicks, Chris McCausland, and Jamie Borthwick will return for week 6, performing routines in Halloween attire for Strictly’s hotly anticipated spooky special. Viewers will be treated to the first Argentine tango of the series from Sarah Hadland, while Sam Quek performs a Time Warp jive and Wynne Evans channels Jamiroquai for his salsa. They’re all desperate to maintain their places in the competition, after Paul Merson was sent home last week – and maybe they’ll have the added pressure of a former Strictly legend watching in the audience? Kevin certainly wouldn’t be the first former Strictly pro to return to the ballroom, as Oti Mabuse was spotted in the crowd last weekend having choreographed a professionals’ number. Speaking previously about Strictly, Kevin, who reached four finals consecutively, spilled some glitzy beans about what goes on behind the cameras. In 2021, the dancer hinted at a feud between one pairing, as it a pro ‘made it obvious’, apparently, that they didn’t like their celebrity partner. He went on to say: ‘It doesn’t happen very often, [but] I have seen it. ‘I won’t name names, but I have seen it from someone who was not happy with their pairing and they made it quite obvious.’ Kevin, who was previously paired with the likes of Susanna Reid, Louis Redknapp, and Susan Calman, has always made it clear though that he would go back to Strictly if the time was right. ‘Would you go back, Kev?’, he was once asked in a Q&A by a fan. He replied: ‘Yes, someone has been asking me this.

Two referees banned by UEFA for drunkenly stealing road sign before Champions League game,Tom Olver,"Oct 26, 2024, 8:14am","Oct 26, 2024, 8:18am","Home,Sport,Football","A pair of match officials have been slapped with lengthy bans by UEFA after they were arrested for drunkenly stealing a road sign in the lead-up to Rangers’ Champions League qualifier with Dynamo Kyiv. While Bartosz Frankowski and Tomasz Musial have both made careers from dishing out punishments, the duo have managed to land themselves in serious hot water over the boozy night out prior to the European contest. Police stated that Frankowski and Musial had been captured on CCTV attempting to carry the said road sign with another individual just hours before kick-off in Lublin, Poland, on August 6 following reports of ‘improper behaviour’. The two Poles received fines at the time and have now been suspended from officiating until June 30 2025 for violating ‘basic rules of decent conduct’ by the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body. ‘At around 1:40am, we received a report of three men carrying a road sign down the street,’ Lublin City Police Senior Superintendent Kamil Golebiowski told TVP Sport in the immediate aftermath. ‘Police officers were dispatched to the scene. All of the men were intoxicated and had over 1.5 per mille of alcohol in their blood. They were taken to a sobering-up centre.’ Frankowski was expected to take charge as the video assistant referee for the game, while Musial had been set to act as his assistant. But the Polish Football Association were forced to quickly call in Tomasz Kwiatkowski and Pawel Malec to replace them in their positions. ‘I am still trying to find words that will sufficiently express how much I regret this incident and how sorry I am,’ Frankowski – who has officiated at Euro 2020 and Euro 2024 – said in a statement. ‘I realise that with one such violation, I ruined 22 years of refereeing, ruined my entire career. I should have calmly prepared for the match and not gone anywhere. ‘As one of the police officers later told me, our prank was spotted by CCTV cameras and they intervened. I would like to clarify that we were in no way aggressive. These were stupid jokes. ‘We did not suspect that it would be perceived this way. We had no bad intentions. It was stupidity, an idiotic fantasy, I don’t even know what to call it.’ According to Frankowski, the pair’s antics with the road side were simply a ‘prank’ and a ‘stupid game’ gone wrong. ‘Now, looking back, I understand that it was not a very smart idea. It was a sign that was lying next to where road works were being carried out and we were passing by,’ he added. ‘I am very sorry that this happened. And on a purely human level, it was stupid, because I know that my unfortunate behaviour will cast a shadow on many years of hard work. ‘What happened was irresponsible and unprofessional on my part, and I am fully aware of that. I would just like to emphasise that there were no acts of aggression in my behaviour, I did not break the law and there was no unlawful behaviour on my part towards police officers or anyone.’ In a separate statement, Musial said: ‘I wholeheartedly apologise to the authorities of the Polish Football Association, especially the Referees’ College, the authorities of Ekstraklasa and all those whom I have disappointed with my attitude. ‘This is the first incident of this type involving me. For many years of my professional career as a referee, I have worked hard to get to where I am today.

I am aware of the consequences that await me, but I hope that I will be able to rehabilitate myself and rebuild your trust.’ Frankowski and Musial were suspended by the Polish FA back in August, prior to the ban from UEFA. The match in question between Dynamo Kyiv and Rangers finished 1-1 after Cyriel Dessers found a last-gasp equaliser for the Scottish Premiership side away from home. However, Rangers were beaten 2-0 in the second leg at Ibrox the following week, meaning Dynamo secured a 3-1 aggregate victory. For more stories like this, check our sport page.

Much-loved London pie shop closing after 116 years,Danny Rigg,"Oct 26, 2024, 12:48pm",,"Home,News,UK","A much-loved pie and mash shop is set to close after being run by the same family for 116 years. Just this week, MPs debated whether to grant protective status to the Cockney classic of pie, mash and licker. But Harringtons Eel and Pie House, a staple server of this London cuisine, has since announced it will be closing its doors after more than a century serving pies on Selkirk Street in Tooting. It’s just the latest in a series of closures that have seen the number dwindle by two thirds since 30 years ago, when there were 60 pie and mash shops across London. Announcing the closure on social media, Harringtons said: ‘As you can imagine it’s not been an easy decision for myself and the family to come to. ‘In fact it’s been very upsetting when it’s been in the family 116 years, but unfortunately as a family we’ve decided we need to move forward, so unfortunately the property is up for sale and once it has sold we will be closing our doors. ‘But until we have sold we are still open and selling hot pie and mash for all our beloved customers to enjoy.’ Mourning the imminent loss of a local icon, one person commented: ‘All my children had their first meal there as babies. I’m so sorry you are closing. I hope and pray a pie n mash lover buys it and keeps up the tradition.’ Another, Lauren said: ‘That is incredibly upsetting news, our family have always visited your pie and mash shop, it was nan’s favourite meal! ‘I even trek all the way down from Birmingham now to have a delicious pie and mash! I will need to squeeze one more visit in before you go.’ To get the latest news from the capital visit Metro.co.uk's London news hub.

"From 90s classics to 00s hits, the kids’ TV shows that deserve a reboot after Pingu",Pierra Willix,"Oct 26, 2024, 2:19pm","Oct 26, 2024, 2:24pm","Home,Entertainment,TV","We’re all used to hearing about how things were ‘in the good old days’, but people do really seem to be having a soft spot for nostalgia at the moment. This year has featured an influx of reunions and reboots for movies, TV shows and bands, with firm favourites from the 90s and noughties whipping up frenzies for fans. From the massive Oasis reunion, a long-awaited Freaky Friday sequel and a Harry Potter reboot, the current cultural output is a throwback to the past. Although there’s no shortage of new releases flooding our TV screens, in recent months it’s been announced we have plenty of old favourites returning too. From Walking with Dinosaurs, Balamory and Pingu, the latter’s revival was announced just last week, with Mattel and Aardman (the studio behind Wallace and Gromit and Chicken Run) to co-produce the new series. However, there’s some other old favourites we’d also love to see come back too. This American animated series aired on Nickelodeon from 1996 until 2004 and followed Arnold Shortman, who lived with his grandparents in an inner-city tenement in the fictional city of Hillwood. The episodes centred on his experiences navigating urban life with his friends. A movie was also released in 2002, while a 2017 big screen adaptation – Hey Arnold!: The Jungle Movie – was released and wrapped up the series’ storyline. The show was praised for showing kid’s growing up in a big city, with one critic writing at the time it ‘showed the reality of millions of kids who grew up in urban areas and challenged the idea of the perfect American life’. Another 90s animated series that picked up a loyal audience was The Magic School Bus, which ran from 1994 until 1997. Based on the book series of the same name, it starred Lily Tomlin as the voice of Ms. Frizzle, an eccentric schoolteacher who took her students on wild adventures on her magical school bus. Traversing time periods, the kids learnt the wonders of science along the way, with celebrities including Dolly Parton, Wynonna Judd and Michael York appearing in guest roles. Although the show was in fact revived in 2017 for Netflix, it wrapped up in 2021, with fans of the franchise still begging for it to be brought back yet again. Millennials likely all still remember the catchy ‘Call me, beep me if you wanna reach me’ theme song of this animated action comedy. Kim Possible followed a teenage girl who was tasked with not only dealing with the trials and tribulations of being a teenager, but also saving the world on a regular basis. She was assisted in her missions by clumsy best friend, Ron Stoppable and pet naked mole rat Rufus, as well as 10-year-old computer genius Wade. One of few female-led animated series, this TV show was groundbreaking and appealed to kids and adults alike. Airing from 2002, it ran for four seasons until 2007, during which time it had become one of Disney’s top-rated and most popular series. During its run, two made-for-TV films were also released – A Sitch in Time (2003) and So the Drama (2005). There was another film released in 2019 but there’s still plenty of fans keen for another TV series to continue the teenage hero’s story. Recess followed a group of sex fourth graders as they went about their daily lives in a school environment at Third Street Elementary School. The school community echoed traditional human society with its own government, class system, and set of unwritten laws, with the students ruled by a sixth grader called King Bob, who had various enforcers ensure his decrees were carried out. The show aired from 1997 until 2001 and a film, Recess: School’s Out, was released the same year the series ended. Two years later two more films were released, and the characters made their final appearance in a crossover episode for Lilo & Stitch: The Series. It was two years ago that the creators revealed they were working on a potential revival, saying: ‘We’ve come up with several different angles and we’ve tried different things. It’s been four years that we’ve been working on it, but that’s an example of how things have changed… things are slower.’ However, there’s been no update since then. First hitting screens in 1989, Babar was based on Jean de Brunhoff’s book series, which was published in 1931. The first two seasons focused on the titular elephant, who after being traumatised by a hunter killing his mother, fled from his home forest to the city, where a kind old lady adopted him and teaches him the ways of human life. He then returned to his forest home and, full of ideas and progress, devised a plan to drive out the hunter and his men, with Babar then being crowned king of he elephants for his heroism. Subsequent seasons focused on his family life in the present day. The show was dubbed in 30 languages in over 150 countries before it ended in 1991. A short-lived revival aired in 2001 and then another in 2010 premiered on Disney Junior. However, 14 years on, the themes contained in the tale are just as relevant and are ripe for another adaptation. In recent years, fans have shared on social media the show ‘made their childhood’s’ and labelled it ‘one of the best cartoons of the 90s’. Animal-obsessed children were always jealous of the adventures Eliza Thornberry got to experience on this animated series. From the same creators of the Rugrats, The Wild Thornberrys aired from 1998 until 2004 and followed a family of nomadic wildlife documentary filmmakers known as the Thornberrys, which consist of the nature documentary television host Nigel, his wife and camera operator Marianne, their 16-year-old daughter Debbie, their younger daughter Eliza, their adopted son Donnie, and a chimpanzee named Darwin. The show particularly focused on Eliza, who had a magical ability to communicate with animals. The family travelled to every continent and wildlife environment in their ComVee. Originally pitched as an adult animated sitcom, the show ended up becoming a family-friendly d series for Nickelodeon. A feature film, The Wild Thornberrys Movie, in which Eliza embarks on a quest to save a cheetah cub from poachers, was released in 2002 while the crossover film Rugrats Go Wild hit screens the following year. The series was praised for encouraging children to be empathetic towards animals, embrace a curiosity towards other cultures and ways of life and to understand the vastness and diversity of the world. Viewers have recently said they’d love to ‘get an idea of where the family would be now’ in a reboot too. Another series that featured female leads saving the day was The Powerpuff Girls, which centred on three kindergarten-aged girls with superpowers – Blossoms, Bubbles and Buttercup. 00s child star shocks with appearance on huge game show One of the 00s' most loved pop icons announces biggest-ever UK headline tour Britain's Got Talent winner has completely different career 16 years after show success Miriam Margolyes, 83, reveals she's 'failing physically' and predicts her death date Living in the fictional city of Townsville with their father and creator, a scientist named Professor Utonium, the trio were frequently called upon by the city’s mayor to help fight nearby criminals and other enemies using their powers. Running for six seasons, three specials, and a feature film, the show aired from 1998 until 2005. The show began airing during the ‘girl power’ movement in the entertainment industry, with the show’s creator Craig McCracken saying it gained momentum during this time due to the appetite for its themes showing strong young women.

When are the clocks going back and why are they changing?,"Laura Brick, Sam Courtney-Guy and Danny Rigg","Oct 26, 2024, 8:31am",,"Home,News,UK","The days are getting shorter, and British Summer Time (BST) will soon make way for good old Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). You’ll get an extra hour of bed as a result of clocks going back this weekend, but there will also be a noticeable change in when the sun goes up and down. Many people say this affects their mood – hello Seasonal Depression – which contributes to a debate over whether this disruption is worthwhile. The clocks next change this Sunday, October 27, when they go back one hour at 2am. So when you go to bed tonight, make sure you’ve adjusted your clock in anticipation or have a device that changes automatically. You can also expect to get an extra hour of sleep if your body lets you, or wake up an hour ‘earlier’ if your body-clock is particularly strong. The clocks will go forward again on Sunday, March 30, 2025, at 1am. When the clocks go back, Daylight Saving Time will then be at an end. This means the sun rises an hour earlier than the day before, and sunset will come one hour earlier in the evening. Turning the clocks back allows us to have extra sunlight in the morning at the expense of the same amount in the evening. The idea was first seriously proposed in the 1890s by British-born New Zealand scientist George Vernon Hudson, whose passion for collecting insects after work inspired him to propose daylight saving time. He suggested a two-hour shift to his government but the proposal was rejected. The idea took off in the UK after businessman William Willett (whose great-great-grandson is Coldplay’s Chris Martin) began promoting the idea starting in 1907. He had been inspired by the sight of houses with their blinds down on sunny mornings near his home in Kent, realising people were ‘wasting’ daylight. His proposal was backed by two MPs, including a young Winston Churchill, but nothing was done until the First World War. The turning point came when Germany moved clocks forward to conserve energy in the spring of 1916, which allowed both soldiers and civilians to use less resources such as coal. Not long after, Parliament passed Britain’s Summer Time Act of 1916, which turned clocks back in the autumn and forward again in spring. Clocks-changing isn’t just a UK thing – more than 70 countries around the globe do it. Most European countries observe European summertime (Daylight Saving) – changing their clocks at the end of March and again at the end of October. The only European countries that don’t are Iceland, Turkey, Belarus and Russia. Neither do nearby Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. Meanwhile, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand observe Daylight Saving. Mexico voted in March 2023 to mostly stop using DST. Most Asian countries, including India, Japan, China and Mongolia, opt not to use Daylight Saving Time, while many Middle Eastern countries also avoid changing their clocks. For some, such as Iran and Jordan, dropping DST is a fairly recent change, while Egypt decided to restore it in 2023. In Africa, most countries do not use it. Morocco does, as do the nearby Canary Islands, which are part of Spain. How the change affects you depends on a variety of factors such as what time you wake up in the morning and your pattern of activity throughout the day – but everyone’s circadian rhythm will adjust regardless. Dr Tim Mercer, an NHS GP Partner and GP Trainer with Opera Beds, told Bristol Live: ‘During the evening and in darkness, the pineal gland increases melatonin production, signalling to the body that it’s time to sleep. ‘Conversely, exposure to daylight suppresses melatonin production, keeping us more alert during the day. ‘With the earlier onset of darkness after the clocks go back, the body may start producing melatonin earlier in the evening, potentially making you feel sleepy earlier than usual. ‘This shift can lead to temporary disruptions in sleep patterns as your body adjusts to the new schedule.’ Numerous studies have found negative effects associated with the start of BST – such as a temporary decline in sleep quality and alertness which can increase the risk of accidents. The end of BST has not been well-studied, but researchers at Liverpool John Mores University are currently looking into it and the wider effects of disruption to people’s perception of time – and you could help. Any UK-based adult who wants to take part in the study can complete an online survey about their experiences this week and/or next week. Dr Mercer provided six tips to help mitigate the effects on our sleep routine. Gradual Adjustments: In the run-up to the time change, you could try shifting your bedtime and wake-up time by 10 to 15 minutes earlier each day. This gentle transition can help ease your body into the new schedule, lessening the shock to your system. Morning Light Exposure: Getting some natural sunlight in the morning can aid in resetting your internal clock. Light is one of the strongest signals for regulating the circadian rhythm, so spending time outside in the early daylight hours can assist your body in adjusting more swiftly. If the lighter mornings are disrupting your sleep routine, consider investing in blackout blinds or a sleep mask.

This helps regulate your body’s internal clock, making it easier to adapt to the new time. Limit Stimulants: Try to avoid caffeine and electronic devices, which emit blue light, at least an hour before bedtime. These can interfere with melatonin production and make it harder to fall asleep. Activity Levels: The onset of autumn and winter may lead many people to reduce time spent on outdoor activities and exercise. Keeping up regular physical activity in winter is generally beneficial for sleep, even a brisk 15-minute walk can have a significant impact. Sleep hygiene: It’s crucial to comprehend what environment boosts your sleep. This encompasses managing lighting, temperature (the perfect bedroom temperature is approximately 16-18C), and noise for a night of profound sleep. Typically, the darker, cooler, and quieter you maintain your sleeping area, the better your odds of sleeping undisturbed. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

								video Sir Trevor McDonald has left fans in awe with his youthful appearance. The broadcaster is best known for his career as a news presenter with Independent Television News (ITN). After working as a print and broadcast journalist in Trinidad, he became a general reported on ITN in 1973 and was also the station’s first black reporter. In 1992 he was promoted to become the sole presenter of News at Ten and seven years later was knighted for his services to journalism. He retired from News at Ten in 2008 but has continued to appear on screens, notably in several documentaries. However, it was his latest TV appearance that saw the 85-year-old leave viewers shocked. Appearing on Saturday Kitchen this weekend, Sir Trevor spoke about his recently released memoir, On Cricket, which details his childhood in the Caribbean and his lifelong love of the titular sport. Commenting on his appearance, viewer Stuart posted on X: ‘I swear Sir Trevor McDonald looks younger than he did 10 years ago.’ Others also expressed their admiration of the broadcaster. ‘I could listen to Sir Trevor all day…’ Rach shared. ‘Sir Trevor is such a lovely man he deserves food heaven…’ user MrChambers added. Also appearing on the show was Scottish chef Julie Lin, who made a Malay-O-Fish burger with homemade chips. However, while Italian chef Gennaro Contaldo was eager to tuck in, Sir Trevor was more focused on the wine despite declaring how much he loved to eat at the start of the show. Some were left somewhat confused after Sir Trevor didn’t appear to touch any of the following dishes he was also presented with on the cooking show. ‘Did Trevor have a full English before the show cause he sure isn’t hungry at all!!!’ one person also shared on X. ‘Trevor isn’t trying anything,’ Susan pointed out. ‘Trevor never touched that last dish. He is not a foodie 🤣🤣’ John shared.

Joe Lycett shares first picture of newborn son after becoming a dad,Brooke Ivey Johnson,"Oct 25, 2024, 6:52pm","Oct 26, 2024, 9:15am","Home,Entertainment,Showbiz","Joe Lycett has just announced that he’s become the father to a brand new baby boy. The comedian and host took to Instagram to share a picture of himself with the infant, surprising fans with the unexpected news. He thanked Birmingham Women’s Hospital in the heartfelt caption, praising them for how they ‘masterfully welcomed a little boy into the world, who happens to be my son.’ While some fans speculated in the comments that this is another of Lycett’s infamous jokes, the post reads as deeply sincere. Lycett wrote that he’s ‘LOVING being a dad’ in the message, which shows him holding the baby under his coat as he seemingly walks through a park. Some fans aren’t buying the news while others are sending their congratulations to Lycett. User @flower_fairy wrote: ‘Im saying congratulations but I’m also thinking this is you and it could easily be a puppy/kitten/gearbox in that hat’ @elladunthorne was equally skeptical, commenting: ‘I can’t tell if this is satire but I’m here for it either way.’ @madnessandmayhemof5uk agreed, joking: ‘I’m just worried this will come out as him cuddling a bunch of rhubarb in a hat tbh.’ But many of the comments on the post take the announcement seriously, with@robjeybee writing: ‘Congratulations that’s amazing. Your wonderful blend of sass, trolling and comedy have gotten me through some dark days recently – and for that I’m very thankful. I wish you and your son all the love in the world.’ @ninawilson112263 wrote: ‘Ah Mummy is a Daddy ❤️❤️❤️ What an incredibly lucky little boy to have such an amazing role model for a dad. This is just fab.’ The comedian is best known for his publicity stunts, appearances on several panel shows, and his own TV show Late Night Lycett. He routinely plays pranks on guests on his show and posts satirical things online, leading to skepticism about this newest announcement. Lycett recently opened up about his long-term partner, a woman he calls ‘Denise,’ choosing not to reveal her real name for the sake of her privacy. Speaking on Bimini Bon-Boulash’s podcast The Pieces, Joe spoke about his partner. ‘So I’ve got Winston the cat, and my partner Denise. And, um, she’s not called Denise, but I don’t talk about her, because she has a job that she can’t be in the public eye,’ he said. ‘I call her Denise because she hates the name Denise, so, uh, I live with Denise.

								video Joe elaborated: ‘Well, it’s interesting now being in a long-term relationship with a woman because loads of people are like, sorry what? There was a brief period when I was at school when I thought because I was attracted to men, I was gay, and then I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on.’ ‘Then I use the term bisexual when anyone asks and I just want to give a quick answer because people understand that. ‘But I think the most accurate way of describing myself is pansexual, in that I’m not attracted to people, just because of their gender. The comedian added that he sometimes struggled to explain his sexuality to ‘idiots’ as it’s more nuanced than fancying every person on earth. Joe Lycett confirms sexuality after revealing girlfriend ‘Denise’ 80s pop icon with massive earworm single unrecognisable 35 years after storming the charts Tom Holland is real-life Spider-Man as he fiercely protects girlfriend Zendaya Katie Price shops for baby clothes after introducing mysterious 'twins' to followers ‘I also don’t really know how it works because, I don’t know, how does it work? As in, I don’t know how it works in terms of like, explaining it to idiots. Because it is hard to sort of go, well, no, I am attracted to men sometimes, but not all men. And it’s not often to do with the fact that they are men. He joked that more often it’s a ‘good torso’ or a ‘lovely arm’ he is interested in. ‘Often it’s like a good torso is enough, you know? The little abs. Yeah, that’s it. The lines. The torso is dangerous. A lovely arm. ‘ It remains unclear if Lycett’s partner is the mother of the new baby or not. Got a story?

Man Utd wonderkid takes just 15 minutes to score hat-trick on full debut after ditching Arsenal,Tony Mogan,"Oct 26, 2024, 12:41pm","Oct 26, 2024, 1:10pm","Home,Sport,Football","Chido Obi-Martin scored a sensational hat-trick inside the opening 15 minutes of his full Manchester United debut for the club’s Under-18 side. The 16-year-old is regarded as one of the best strikers in his age group, emerging as a top talent at Arsenal having once scored 10 goals in a single game against Liverpool at Under-16 level. In total, be bagged 32 goals in 24 appearances at youth level for the Gunners and trained with the first-team before United swooped this summer. The Dane left Arsenal at the end of his contract, agreeing a deal with United with the move officially given the green light in September. And Arsenal fans may be left wincing after hearing of their former starlet’s sensational start to life in Manchester. He made his first appearance for United’s Under-18 side last week, coming off the bench for the final half hour in a 4-3 win against Sunderland. Named in the starting XI on Saturday afternoon, he put Nottingham Forest to the sword after just 12 seconds, pouncing on a mistake at the back to coolly slot home. Four minutes later he had a second, picking up the ball on the edge of the box after a poor clearance and drilling into the bottom corner. Man Utd consider hiring Premier League boss to replace Erik ten Hag 'I coached Cole Palmer with England - he's brilliant but has one weakness' Sergio Aguero names his three 'favourites' to win the Champions League Real Madrid forward told he can become an 'absolute superstar' at Arsenal A dream debut was sealed before the 15-minute mark as he completed his hat-trick. Latching onto a cross from James Scanlon, Obi-Martin produced a smart finish from just outside the six yard area. Obi-Martin left Arsenal this summer having failed to agree terms on a new scholarship deal and was wanted by several top European clubs, including Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. United reportedly agreed to double the wages that were being offered his way in north London. The presence of legendary striker Ruud van Nistelrooy at Old Trafford also played a factor. Van Nistelrooy returned to Manchester in the summer, joining Erik ten Hag’s backroom staff. The Dutchman personally spoke to the young striker ahead of the move, discussing his potential pathway to the first-team.

Having concerns about the effectiveness and robustness of some of the airers I had seen, I decided on this one after reading the reviews. I have used it twice and am very happy with it.

Popular BBC series confirms TV return date for ‘reboot’ season with unexpected cast shake up,Stephen Patterson,"Oct 24, 2024, 12:01am","Oct 24, 2024, 7:33pm","Home,Soaps","The new series of Hope Street is only just around the corner and it’s all change in Port Devine. The BBC One series, which made its TV debut in 2021, returns for a brand new eight episode season on Friday, November 1. Prior to its UK TV premiere, however, the entire season will be available to stream on BBC iPlayer from 7pm on Monday, October 28 – shortly after its premiere on BBC One NI. The popular daytime drama, which has proven quite the force to be reckoned with, follows the lives of residents and the local police department of fictional Northern Irish seaside town Port Devine. The fourth series, which Marlene Pettigrew star Kerri Quinn likens to a ‘reboot’, is its most different to date, with a number of significant cast changes lined up, including the arrival of a brand new Inspector in the form of Eve Dunlop, played by Derry Girls star Tara Lynne O’Neill. Eve’s tough no-nonsense demeanour sets the cat among the pigeons, with Marlene’s nose well and truly put out of joint. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web

								video ‘Because Eve has known Marlene since school, there is a lovely crossover between the personal and the professional – and there’s stuff to play there,’ said newcomer Tara Lynne of the conflict. ‘How do you manage your friend? And they haven’t even been friends since they were teenagers so all this time has passed – so who’s in charge? Who’s not in charge? She needs Marlene on her side but also has to put her in her place.’ The feuding friends, however, put their differences aside when the real reason for Eve’s arrival come to light. Port Devine also welcomes a host of new faces, including feisty new ‘firecracker’ barmaid Brandi McClure, played by Katie Shortt. ‘Brandi’s very fun!’, exclaimed actress Katie. ‘She brings a fun energy to the show and she’s very obsessed with Nicole!’. We’ve also got Lois Dunlop (Eleanor Methven), the formidable mother of Eve, plus Chloe Jackson (RhéAna Kamalu), Eve’s diplomatic step-daughter, and Ross Dunlop (Jonny Grogan), Eve’s troubled son, who all make for exciting additions. ‘Chloe is apprehensive [about moving to Port Devine] but quickly it’s a breath of fresh air’, said RhéAna. ‘It’s very nice for her to feel welcome. She’s a firecracker! A fun and a confident young woman.’ Jonny, meanwhile, added of his character: ‘Ross is having a bit of trouble at school. He’s supported by his stepsister, who he can confide in. He wants to be the perfect son – and he doesn’t want to burden anyone with what he’s going through.’ There’s also a new Detective Constable in town. Played by Ted Lasso star Marcus Onilude, newcomer Luke Jackson certainly makes his presence felt – and he and Eve seem to be very well acquainted, with sparks flying between the two! ‘It’s a very different year,’ said Kerri Quinn of all the changes. ‘We have so many new people, so it feels almost like a reboot. You need that fresh energy.’ ‘I know if I’m watching something, I don’t particularly like change. “Who’s this guy? Who is she? What’s this about?”, but [introducing the newcomers] is a “gently, gently” process. ‘People will miss characters that haven’t come back this year, so it’s important for us to stay true to things like the Marlene and Nicole friendship, which has been there from the get-go.’ Despite all the changes there are still plenty of returning favourites in Hope Street season 4, including the loveable PC Callum McCarthy (Niall Wright) who – quite rightly – is right at the centre of the drama this year. His father Seamie (Paddy Jenkins) makes a surprise appearance and there’s also his romance with Jo Lipton (Karen Hassan), which was running smoothly at the end of series three. But will there be trouble in paradise this year? Discussing what’s to come, actor Niall Wright said: ‘At the end of series three everything was pretty rosy for Callum. He’d met Jo, they fell in love and made everything official. They were looking to move up to Belfast. So, as this series begins, there are a few things that make that a bit tricky! They look at whether they can actually move and whether or not Callum wants to go. ‘I always said that it would be nice to see what goes on at home and to give a bit of history to him – a bit of backstory about why he is the way that he is.’ We certainly get that in the fourth series! And speaking of Callum, there is also the matter of Nicole Devine-Dunwoody’s (Niamh McGrady) pregnancy. Will he discover that he might be the father of the unborn child after he and Nicole slept together last year? Or will Nicole’s roguish husband Clint (Aaron McCusker) ultimately prove to be the dad? ‘We’ve been on such a journey with Nicole’s fertility issues, so it’s bittersweet that there’s so much complication involved when she finally gets her motherhood moment,’ said actress Niamh. ‘This is all Nicole has ever wanted and she’s finally about to get it – though not without a few complications!’ Ryan Power is also back for series four, with star Finnian Garbutt telling us that his character is more confident this time around. ‘You can tell Ryan is learning from the mistakes he made in previous series. And he’s got his own desk this year!’ In terms of what else viewers can expect, there is also a kidnap on the cards, plus plenty of crimes and mysteries to be solved – in addition to a familiar face staging a return. Also, a tragedy casts a shadow over Port Devine. EastEnders may be about to bring back its most shockingly controversial story ever Coronation Street videos 'confirm' killer as unexpected connection is made Coronation Street star explains the 'isolation and fear' of cancer diagnosis at 19 All Emmerdale cast returns, exits and new arrivals coming up in the ITV soap With a perfect blend of the old and the new, Hope Street returns as strong as it ever was for an exciting new chapter – one that most certainly is not to be missed. The BBC series has proven incredibly popular in the UK and beyond. The first series centred on the arrival of the Leila Hussain (Amara Karan), whose presence got tongues wagging, while the second saw new detective Al join the police force, causing quite the stir. The third series, which Metro deemed its best to date, saw Jo Lipton’s arrival setting the cat among the pigeons – not to mention Callum’s heart racing.

EastEnders confirms unexpected outcome as The Six’s fate is ‘sealed’ in 41 pictures,Stephen Patterson,"Oct 25, 2024, 8:00am",,"Home,Soaps,EastEnders","EastEnders lines up a particularly spooky Halloween season, as confirmed in my new spoiler pictures, and it’s not looking too good for The Six as the walls close in. The Six, as viewers know, have been desperately trying to keep the events of last Christmas under wraps, after they almost killed abuser Nish Panesar (Navin Chowdhry) and claimed the life of Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters). Nish has long had his suspicions about what really happened over the festive season and, next week, his suspicions grow after he overhears a clandestine meeting between Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) and Suki (Balvinder Sopal). Determined to get to the bottom of what the women are hiding, he wastes little time in digging deeper as he rumbles their secret get-together. The women desperately try to remember their statements from Christmas, while Nish accompanies them to the station as they’re re-interviewed by DC Arthurs. With Nish piling on the pressure and seemingly holding her over a barrel, Suki lures her fellow matriarchs to No. 41 under false pretences and things escalate quite dramatically, as the women realise just how much danger they’re in, with their futures left hanging in the balance.

Hollyoaks fan favourite Isabelle Smith swaps soaps with new role in rival show,Calli Kitson,"Oct 25, 2024, 8:46am","Oct 25, 2024, 8:51am","Home,Soaps,Hollyoaks","Hollyoaks star Isabelle Smith is set to appear in her third soap after securing a role in BBC’s Doctors. The young actress, who currently plays Frankie Osborne in the Channel 4 show, also featured in ITV’s Coronation Street back in 2022, portraying the role of Sonya – a friend of Max Turner’s (Paddy Bever). Isabelle has been at the centre of a heartbreaking and powerful storyline in Hollyoaks, as character Frankie has tried to move forward after being sexually abused by her brother JJ (Ryan Mulvey). After being manipulated by her sibling into keeping quiet, Frankie bravely confided in dad Darren (Ashley Taylor Dawson), who never doubted her for a second, disowning JJ for what he did and vowing to help his daughter get justice.

Darren has struggled to come to terms with such a thing, finding himself torn between being by Frankie’s side while also trying to be there for JJ following his diagnosis. Next week, Isabelle will swap Channel 4 for the BBC to feature in Doctors. She will play a character called Bea Reynolds. Judging by pictures from the episodes, Isabelle will act alongside Doctors legend Chris Walker, who plays police officer Rob Hollins, as well as Joanna Bending – who has starred in EastEnders this week.

Coronation Street killing off Les Battersby feels unnecessary – but not as much as the dramatic reaction,Duncan Lindsay,"Oct 25, 2024, 6:30am","Oct 25, 2024, 9:29am","Home,Soaps,Coronation Street","Les Battersby dead!? How can Coronation Street ever go on? The reaction to news that the gobby cabbie will meet his maker next month has caused a surprisingly fierce uproar, and one that I didn’t expect. Les, who many forgot existed until actor Bruce Jones started to take to the professional wrestling ring at the age of 71, will be killed off in a surprise decision from Corrie bosses. I say surprise in the sense that we haven’t really heard about Les since 2007 and declaring him dead seems unnecessary. Is it just to facilitate more heartbreak for Leanne and Toyah (Jane Danson and Georgia Taylor) in a year where one was revealed to have buried their stillborn baby and the other was drawn into a sinister cult? Killing characters off-screen needs to have a real purpose, and it’s a soap trope that has become too common. Les was never a favourite character of mine but, yes, I agree that there doesn’t seem much point in killing him for what I imagine is a short-term storyline to unite the warring siblings. Am I outraged? Am I calling for the heads of those at the top? Is Corrie on the skids without Les? Well, no – of course not. It’s been nearly three decades since we saw Les, a character who already felt like an outdated stereotype at that stage. When he first arrived in 1997, to huge fan and critic backlash, he was a violent, abusive lout, chucking punches about like wedding confetti. He was largely toned down into a buffoon like comedy character in later years but it wasn’t really enough to paper over the significant cracks formed through the character’s vile transphobia and homophobia. At the time, there was an argument that the show needed a character like Les to show the bigotry faced by the LGBTQ+ community and I wholeheartedly agree. Until much later though, Les – and even beloved characters like Vera – got away mostly unchallenged with some of the most horrific comments, slurs and insults. Genuinely words you wouldn’t see uttered on TV these days. Time has moved on and by the time Les went, he had been fleshed out a bit more. He proved to be a decent father figure to Chesney and what started off as a horrific neighbour from hell scenario turned into a camp pairing with the monstrous Cilla. The latter was less offensive, but rarely entertaining. No amount of glancing through rose-tinted spectacles can convince me otherwise. So why is everyone so upset that Les is getting a final ending? The ‘last straw for Corrie’ vibe feels dramatically over the top. I don’t think that losing a character from 27 years ago will be what finishes off the British institution. Love him, loathe him or be largely indifferent to him like me, Les belongs in Corrie’s past and was never going to return, even without considering the cloud Bruce Jones left under. Unless the character came back with a personality transplant, there was never really scope for him fitting into the show. And there was never really a call for it until now, when it’s too late. Coronation Street star explains the 'isolation and fear' of cancer diagnosis at 19 Gary takes action in Coronation Street as a child's life is on the line Coronation Street car crash shock as the Platts are left stunned Corrie legend declares love for ex - but she doesn't react well We’re kidding ourselves if we claim we have been waiting almost 18 years for the announcement of Les to make his comeback. So the fury of knowing what we already knew – he’s not coming back – is misplaced. Wading through the accusations of ‘woke’ (ah yes, that old classic), it’s clear that dismay at this decision is just there for dismay sake. It’s fair to say that Les was a big part of Corrie’s history, but history is where he belongs. Dead or alive, there was never any doubt about that.

But oh my God!’, he said in a chat with Radio Times. ‘I sat there watching this story unfolding in the Queen Vic that happens on Christmas Day, and as a fan of the show anyway, I was like, “Oh my God I can’t believe this!

I had to do a line and I kept messing it up because I was so taken in with that the storyline that was happening.’ ‘You’re in for a lovely treat this Christmas Day.’ This development left us feeling even more concerned for Linda Carter, a character fans are worried will be killed off after cast were pictured filming a funeral – and Kellie Bright was nowhere to be seen.

80s pop icon with massive earworm single unrecognisable 35 years after storming the charts,Lillie Rohan,"Oct 25, 2024, 11:30pm",,"Home,Entertainment,Showbiz","She may be unrecognisable in recent pictures, but over three decades ago, she sang the chart-topping hit, All Around The World, that you just couldn’t get out of your head. Now 58, Lisa Stansfield has swapped singing for shopping after she was spotted in London earlier this week doing some browsing with her producer husband, Ian Devaney, 59. Never one for an overly dramatic look, the eighties icon fitted in among the other masses on Regent Street in a stylish pair of dark denim jeans with rolled up cuffs, black boots and a brown blazer. Keeping warm in the increasingly cooler weather, the singer paired her look with a grey scarf and cosy black beenie hat. Meanwhile, Ian paired his black Dr. Martens with matching skinny jeans, a t-shirt and a crisp charcoal blazer. Seen holding hands as they walked down the busy street, Lisa and Ian, who have been married since 1998, looked to be sharing jokes with each other before they slipped into DJI Retail. The love birds met in the mid-1980s at school when they both signed up to star in the school play. However, things didn’t take a romantic turn until years later as Lisa tied the knot with Italian designer Augusto Grassi. The 1987 marriage lasted only four months, during which, Lisa returned to the UK where she and Ian reconnected over their passion for music and teamed up with friend Andy Morris, to form the band Blue Zone. The band saw some success, but in 1989, Lisa signed her first solo deal and released her debut album, Affection, in November of that year. She kept her former bandmates close, and the trio co-wrote all the songs on the record together. As Lisa’s career took off, so did her and Ian’s love and they eventually tied the knot in 1989 in New York City’s Washington Square Park with only her parents and his mother in attendance. During her career, Lisa has released eight studio albums and sold over 20 million records worldwide. The Voice UK's most successful winner replaced iconic 80s band's lead singer 80s rock star, 68, 'looking great' as fans support him after blood cancer diagnosis 80s James Bond actor, 78, unrecognisable in rare sighting 80s rock band sparks outrage over 'arrogant' statement to fans She has also won three Brit awards, a Billboard Music Award, and been nominated for multiple awards, including two Grammy Awards, for her most well-known hit, All Around The World. The track, which she co-wrote with Ian and Andy, was released as a single to promote her first album and catapulted her into global fame. It became the first of two UK number-one singles for her and the first of eight top-ten hits in the country. By 2005, Lisa’s new music was struggling to reach the right audience and after a European tour, she took a break until 2013 when she did a greatest hits tour and later announced her seventh studio album, Seven. Lisa last released music in April 2018 and last took the stage in 2021 when she appeared as a special guest for Simply Red’s Summer Tour. Got a story?

The Voice UK’s most successful winner replaced iconic 80s band’s lead singer,Pierra Willix,"Oct 26, 2024, 8:00am",,"Home,Entertainment,TV","A former winner of The Voice UK who was once in a pop group is now the lead singer of an 80s band. After deciding to pursue a career in performing when he was a teenager, Kevin Simm formed the indie-pop band AnAlien in 1996. Three years later he applied for the ITV talent show Stars in Their Eyes, where he appeared as Simon Fowler of Ocean Colour Scene. Then, in 2001, Kevin auditioned for the series Popstars, where he was one of the finalists. Although he didn’t win the series, alongside other finalists Tony Lundon, Jessica Taylor, Kelli Young and Michelle Heaton, they formed Liberty X. Their group signed a multimillion-pound record contract with Richard Branson and V2 Records and released three albums, which featured seven Top 10 singles. But after selling over three million records worldwide, they split up in 2007. After releasing a solo album the following, Kevin, who is now 44, performed at festivals at pubs before Liberty X reunited six years later for a TV series and tour. While the group did later re-form, it was as a girl group without the two men. Although he was offered roles on reality shows like Celebrity Big Brother in the following years, Kevin said he ‘didn’t want to be a celebrity like that’. ‘I don’t want to be a celebrity like that,’ he added. ‘If people know me for my singing and music that’s what I want, and if a bit of fame comes with that that’s great but I wouldn’t want to be famous for going in a house,’ he told Metro in 2016. Although he did appear on The Games in 2005, Kevin said he simply said yes to that as he had ‘got a bit tubby and it was a good way to lose weight’. Last year Kevin spoke about having to turn to a string of jobs out of the spotlight during this time to support his wife Laura and their two children, Charlie and Oliver. From working as an electrician, a fencer and a wedding photographer between occasional singing gigs, he said ‘it was strange coming out of a big pop group and having to start again’. “I was singing in pubs and clubs for £150 a gig but there wasn’t a lot of work going around and typically it was only Friday or Saturday night. ‘Then sometimes I’d get a call the night before saying the gig was cancelled and that’s half of your income for the week gone,’ he told The Sun. After ‘getting frustrated with the insecurity of singing’ Kevin was also told by some people who booked him for gigs they did so thinking ‘it would be hilarious if I was tone-deaf and couldn’t sing’, questioning his abilities after being part of a pop group. It was in 2016 that Kevin gave singing another go and auditioned for the fifth season of The Voice, where he sung Sia’s Chandelier in his Blind Audition. All four coaches – will.i.am, Ricky Wilson, Boy George and Paloma Faith – turned their chairs, with Kevin choosing to join Paloma’s team. Before stepping up to the stage, Kevin had felt ‘frustrated’ and like his music career had gone backwards, however he still had ‘a bit of fight left’. He thought that even if none of the judges turned, it could have at least opened a few doors. ‘I didn’t want to be famous again, I just wanted a challenge and to bump up my gig money,’ he explained. After performing songs like Wings by Birdy, Rolling in the Deep by Adele and Stay by Rihanna throughout the competition, he was eventually announced as the winner. His winner’s single All You Good Friends peaked at number 24 in the UK. However, at the time he said he didn’t feel significant pressure to chart as ‘people expect so little from a Voice winner’. He echoed these sentiments last year, saying: ‘It’s not me slagging the show off but how many seasons have gone by, and you’ve never had a winner who has become a successful commercial star? I think they need to change the format.’ In 2018 Kevin again joined a band, this time replacing original member Mati Pellow in the soft rock band Wet Wet Wet after one of his new bandmates wife saw him on The Voice. 80s pop icon with massive earworm single unrecognisable 35 years after storming the charts 80s rock star, 68, 'looking great' as fans support him after blood cancer diagnosis 80s James Bond actor, 78, unrecognisable in rare sighting 80s rock band sparks outrage over 'arrogant' statement to fans The Scottish band, who formed in 1982, are best known for their 1994 cover of the Troggs’ 1960s hit Love Is All Around, which was used on the soundtrack to the film Four Weddings and a Funeral and spent 15 weeks at the top of the British charts. They had also been awarded Best British Newcomer at the 1988 Brit Awards. Although Kevin has conceded he is ‘not a big name and not in the charts’ he said he was thrilled to have been able to make a living out of singing since leaving school and that all of his hard work had ‘finally paid off’. I sold my £2,000,000 Omaze house — the best thing about it was the lawnmower What I Own: I paid the deposit for my £320,000 Isleworth one-bed by borrowing from my boss The 'beautiful' county where houses are on the market for £35,000 Homes with these 3 features are selling faster than the rest What I Rent: I pay £1,895 for my one-bedroom Battersea flat, but I don't have my own oven The Voice finale airs tonight at 8.10pm on ITV1.

Three NASA astronauts and a fourth from the Russian space agency spent almost eight months at the International Space Station after their homecoming had been stalled by problems with the Starliner capsule. The crew splashed down off Florida’s coast at 7.29am on Friday aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon. The astronaut, who NASA did not name for privacy reasons, is understood to be suffering from a medical issue, but the agency did not disclose what it is as of yet.

Coronation Street icon says sad goodbye to co-star as their death is confirmed,Calli Kitson and Michael Adams,"Oct 26, 2024, 11:00am",,"Home,Soaps,Coronation Street","To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web

								video Coronation Street’s Channique Sterling-Brown shared an adorable video to pay tribute to co-star Calum Lill. Channique portrays solicitor Dee-Dee Bailey in the show, who began a relationship with Calum’s character Joel Deering last year. What followed next was a storyline that saw Dee-Dee progress in her relationship with Joel, completely unaware he was hiding his true self. Earlier this year, it was revealed that Joel was responsible for Lauren Bolton’s (Cait Fitton) disappearance. It transpired that the lawyer is actually an evil, manipulative individual who preys on vulnerable young women. After meeting Lauren last year, Joel regularly paid her visits and gave her money to pay for food and water. As time ticked by, Joel manipulated Lauren into having sex with him as a repayment. Once Dee-Dee discovered the real Joel Deering, she became determined to destroy him and put him behind bars. This situation changed dramatically a few days ago, however, as Kit Green (Jacob Roberts) and DS Lisa Swain (Vicky Myers) found Joel’s car on a bridge along with a note, which suggested he had ended his life. Earlier this month, Joel’s body was discovered in a river by a group of lads. The body was taken for a post-mortem, where Kit learnt that Joel was dead before he entered the water, meaning he had been murdered. While the likes of Dee-Dee, Lauren, Ed Bailey (Trevor Michael Georges) and even DS Swain all remain prime suspects in the investigation, Joel’s death of course means we have said goodbye to Calum Lill. For Channique Sterling-Brown, saying goodbye to someone she’s worked so closely with over the past year was tough. Reminiscing on her Instagram, the star recently shared a sweet montage video of her and Calum’s time in Weatherfield together. With the video including clips of them walking to set and having fun behind the scenes, the star wrote alongside: ‘RIP Joel Deering. You were flipping awful but you came in the form of one of my best mates and for that I’m very grateful. A year of shenanigans, endless brews, rehearsing only to get distracted and you carrying all my stuff. Want to be the first to hear shocking EastEnders spoilers? Who’s leaving Coronation Street?

Potential Improvements for the Future: talkSPORT BET falls short when it comes to payment methods. We appreciated that the site supported highly secure and trustworthy baking options, but there just weren’t enough to adequately cater to a wide audience. The close integration of the sportsbook and the casino site was pretty good, but they were almost too well-integrated, with the casino feeling more like an afterthought next to the obvious care put into the sportsbook.

Combined, these two factors add up to a convenient platform that can cater to most any player! Potential Improvements for the Future: Regardless of what you’re in the mood for — slots, blackjack, roulette, baccarat, bingo, crash games or live game shows — Madslots has it all! Although, you’ll only find table games through the live dealer section of the site, with no virtual card games available.

Luck Casino at a glance: What We Liked: This casino doesn’t beat around the bush when it comes to performance and satisfaction. Luck Casino offers an attractive betting site with 1300+ games and plenty of promotions to take advantage of. We can clearly see that Luck is a site concerned with pleasing its users and is conscientious of the experience it provides. However, we did note the lack of standard table games, which is still a disappointment even when we consider all your favourite table games are available in the live casino tab. But other games like slots and bingo are plentiful at Luck Casino. Luck Casino continued to impress us when we looked a little deeper. For starters, it offered dedicated mobile apps for iOS and Android devices, so players could play on the go or through a tablet. The cherry on top was the safety standards at Luck Casino, with the expected UKGC licence, encryption security employed site-wide and an excellent range of responsible gambling tools at your disposal. Potential Improvements for the Future: The range of payment options was good, with debit cards, e-wallets and pay-by-mobile to pick from, even though the transaction speed wasn’t very fast. Despite this minor detail, Luck Casino proves itself to be a reliable casino that cares about its customers, although if you’re a fan of classic casino games, you might want to try somewhere else.

Mr Q is a modern gambling site through and through, appealing to the modern aesthetic with clean lines and eye-catching pastels that are particularly popular with younger audiences. But Mr. Q’s quality doesn’t lie solely in its design, also hosting a varied and entertaining library of games — a little smaller than some of its competitors but good all the same! The collection of promotions was also notable because, while it was relatively small, each deal was generous and worthwhile, including a welcome bonus, free spins and refer-a-friend deals. This site keeps getting better as we take a deeper look at the user experience. MrQ supports various payment options, including debit cards, PayPal, and pay-by-mobile, and it boasts lightning-fast withdrawal speeds at a minimum of 4 hours! And all of this is available on the mobile apps too, available to download on Android and iOS devices!

A free spins no deposit bonus is exactly what you might think it is — a free spins bonus that can be claimed without making a deposit. You can receive no-deposit free spins in many ways, such as welcome bonuses, VIP schemes, daily log-in bonuses and even social media giveaways. However, we’ve always found that no-deposit free spins are most commonly found in smaller quantities as recurring bonuses rather than as a part of a larger seasonal or welcome bonus. While no-deposit free spins might sound too good to be true, there is a trade-off — wagering requirements. This won’t always be true, but you will commonly find that free spins have high wagering requirements, meaning you have to wager their value many times before you can claim any money you win. Always check the terms and conditions before claiming a casino bonus! If you’re interested in finding out more about the best free spins no deposit bonuses in the UK, click here. There’s a multitude of ways to claim free spins no deposit offers. Since they’re most common as recurring bonuses for returning customers, there isn’t a single way to claim them. For example, if they’re distributed as a log-in bonus, you might use them by going to their valid game. Or you might collect free spins from the VIP scheme page. However, since our experts have recommended five generous no-deposit free spins welcome bonuses, perfect for starting off your online casino journey, we’ll walk you through the steps for signing up to a new site and collecting these. If you have a recurring free spins bonus on your hands, the instructions for claiming them will be listed under the deal’s banner in the promotions tab. Free spins no deposit bonuses are excellent, but they’re hardly the only free spins available at UK casino sites! Here’s a closer look at some of the other free spins bonuses you can claim when playing at online casinos: The exact opposite of free spins that don’t require a deposit are the ones that do! These free spins can be claimed by depositing into your casino account and collecting them from the promotions tab. While this may sound like a downgrade, free spins you pay for often have lower wagering requirements and a higher value per spin. Not only that, but these free spins usually come alongside another bonus, such as a deposit match bonus with free spins thrown in on the side. A type of bonus that’s been finding a foothold in the modern online casino space is no-wagering bonuses, i.e. a bonus that doesn’t have to be wagered before withdrawing. You’ll need to use no-wagering free spins at least once, but after that, the winnings are yours! As you might expect, these free spins tend to have lower values and are much more likely to require a deposit to claim, but you’re also far more likely to win real money when you use them. Some free spins aren’t connected to regular slot games, but instead to prize wheels that are specific to the casino you’re playing at. These free spins allow you to spin this specific wheel with the chance to win excellent prizes. This can include regular free spins, bonus funds, loyalty points and even giant jackpots. Spin the Wheel free spins are commonly dealt as login bonuses and don’t have any wagering requirements attached to them. Sometimes, an online casino might be eager to promote a specific payment method or just want to incentivise you to register for a payment method and commit a little more. As such, you can sometimes claim free spins just for registering a new payment card. You’ll receive these after registering your card and sometimes once you’ve made a deposit with it. Free spins on card registration tend to have lower wagering requirements too! Verification is one of the most annoying parts of online gambling. Online casinos don’t want to risk giving out money to fake accounts or cheaters, which is perfectly reasonable. However, it means that sites will conduct background checks and make us go through long and often irritating verification processes before we can withdraw any winnings. Free spins on verification are thus here to provide a little more incentive to follow through with this process, giving you a small reward on the flip side. Last up, we have daily free spins. You can receive these for doing nothing more than logging in! Most of the time, daily free spins will be attached to a specific slot game, which you can boot up and play a few times for free! These are surprisingly common nowadays, and most online casinos will feature daily spins in some form or another. Daily free spins are easy to come across, don’t usually require any deposits to claim and sometimes don’t even have wagering requirements! Always keep your eyes out for a site that offers these. While free spins are tempting, you shouldn’t claim them without a little bit of forethought. Free spins bonuses aren’t made equally, after all. And not every free spins bonus will appeal to how you like to play! So, how can you tell a good bonus from a weak one? The first thing we recommend checking out is the important terms and conditions like wagering requirements and win limits. The best free spins bonuses will have lower wagering requirements, as you’re far more likely to win something when playing with them. And then you want spins with a high win limit, so you aren’t capped when you try to withdraw. These two conditions will be at odds, so you want to find the best balance between the two. Next, you want to look at what games your free spins are compatible with — for some people, this won’t be a concern, but you’ll have a better time if they’re attached to a slot game you like. Better yet, aim for slot games with lower volatility and higher RTPs, as while they don’t win so big, they return more reliably, which helps when trying to meet steep wagering requirements. Finally, pick a free spins bonus that works for your play style. While this article is primarily about no-deposit free spins, those won’t be the best choice for everyone. If you’re on a small budget and don’t care so much about winning, no-deposit spins are a great choice, as they’re entirely free but have higher wagering. If you’re more concerned about winning money, you should instead look at no-wagering bonuses or maybe daily bonus spins. Consider what you expect from your gambling experience before committing. All online casino bonuses come with extensive terms and conditions. And while reading through them is a drag, it’s crucial that you understand the broad strokes before you claim anything. No-deposit free spins bonuses typically have similar T&Cs, so we’ve outlined some of the most important points you should consider. The most important condition you want to check out is your bonus’s wagering requirements. This is the number of times you need to wager the value of your free spins before you can withdraw anything you win when using them. For example, if your bonus is worth £10 with WRs of 40x, you need to wager £400 in bonus funds. Unfortunately, no-deposit free spins often have very high wagering requirements, making it difficult to win anything. While many modern casino promotions don’t require a promo code to claim them, that isn’t universal. In fact, many promotions do require bonus codes and simply input them automatically when you sign up through a link. If you need a bonus code, it should be in big, bold font at the top of your bonuses description page, so double-check this before confirming account creation or finalising any deposits. Similar to wagering requirements, max win limits are in place to limit your ability to cash out, just in a much more direct way. This places a specific cap on the amount of money you can withdraw from bonus funds. Often, you find that free spins with lower wagering requirements have stricter win limits and vice versa. If you want to avoid disappointment down the line, make sure you know your maximum win before claiming. Free spins bonuses are limited to one or a handful of games when you initially use them. So it’s a good idea to check out which games your no-deposit free spins are compatible with. But unless you have a no-wagering bonus, you’ll also need to know the restrictions after that point. After you’ve used the free spins once, you can take your bonus winnings and wager them on other games to meet your WR — but not all games will count equally. Typically, slots contribute 100% but table games and progressive jackpots either contribute less or won’t count at all! You should know which games will count before working towards the wagering requirements. Once you’ve claimed your free spins, you won’t have unlimited time to use them. While the time you’ll have to use your spins changes between sites, typically, it will be around seven days after receipt. You may also have limited time to claim a bonus, especially if it’s a limited-time offer or a welcome bonus. So look out for all expiry times in the bonus T&Cs. While a casino site might support many payment options, they won’t all be compatible with your bonus. This is often to prevent fraud, but if you aren’t careful, it could lock you out of claiming your free spins bonus. On the plus side, no-deposit free spins will not require you to worry about this, although it might influence how you withdraw any winnings. You should expect this to be limited to bank transfers. Free spins have a fixed value. This value is how much every wager you make with them is worth. This is different from the total value of the bonus, which is important for knowing the wagering requirements for a deal, but you might need to learn each spin’s individual worth before you can calculate the total. This will usually be listed pretty high in the T&Cs, and we recommend figuring it out. We’ve briefly discussed the idea of spin value, but why is it important? Most of the time, free spins are advertised based on how many of them there are instead of how much the bonus is worth. As such, you’ll need to figure it out yourself. Don’t worry, this is much easier than it might sound. First up, figure out which numbers you already know. There are three possible numbers: number of spins, spin value and total value. You can use any two to figure out the third. We’ll assume you always know how many spins you have. To determine the total value, just multiply the spin value by the total number of spins. As an example, take talkSPORT BET’s welcome bonus: 50 spins worth 10p each will be worth £5 in total. Then, you just do the opposite to find the spin value: divide the total value by the number of spins. So, 50 free spins worth £5 total would be worth 10p each. Bonuses are an excellent way to kick off your gambling journey or enhance your play session. But there are optimal ways to use them to get the most from your free spins. To start with, you shouldn’t claim them to win something, but to have as much fun as possible — responsible gambling begins with the expectation that you’ll lose everything! Optimising your account to accrue more bonuses is also a great way to enhance play, either through reward clubs or VIP schemes. And if you’re serious about your bonuses, you can sign up for newsletters or follow your casino on social media to receive timely updates about new promotions and seasonal periods. Most importantly though, regardless of how good a casino bonus looks, always ensure you’re signing up for a legit casino. In the UK, it’s relatively easy to find a reliable casino, but you can check more than just the UKGC licence for signs of quality: Once upon a time, mobile casino apps were renowned for being vastly inferior to their desktop-based companions, but those days are far behind us! You can claim all the same bonuses through your mobile device that you can on your computer, and sometimes you can claim exclusives. You can then use your free spins through the mobile app too! Playing through mobile devices is convenient, providing a streamlined play experience through your touchscreen. And for some people, tablets and smartphones have become their primary source of internet access, making catering to the mobile market much more important. However mobile apps can run slower a lot of the time, and they aren’t all made equal either. Plus, mobile gambling is a particular no-no for problem gamblers. Free spins can come in as many different values as there are casinos to offer them! However, you’ll find that free spins tend to come in a few specific quantities. And the number of free spins you’re receiving can sometimes be a clue about the T&Cs attached to them: The UKGC’s main goal is to protect the public and vulnerable individuals. Legalising online gambling will help regulate it better. This means that all online casinos must offer self-regulation tools such as helplines like GAMSTOP and must prevent vulnerable users from accessing their sites. It’s also important for you to take responsibility. Don’t hesitate to use the available tools, such as helplines, deposit limits, betting limits, and time limits. The UK even offers an internet-wide exclusion from all participating casino sites. Free spins no deposit deals are exciting and generous bonuses that let you explore a new casino site risk-free or just net you a bit of free play at the beginning of your play session. No-deposit free spins come in many forms, notably welcome bonuses and daily bonuses, making them a versatile promotion that you can find at many online casinos! Just bear in mind that there are plenty of T&Cs you need to keep an eye out for and that there are other free spins bonuses to consider. If you want to claim some no-deposit free spins right now, any of our five recommendations are high-quality sites and can guarantee you a good time. Yes, you can really claim free spins for nothing and be confident it’s a legit deal! Just ensure you’re claiming it from a trustworthy source by looking for a gambling licence. Free spins can only be used on their assigned games, but the bonus funds you win can then be used on other games. The main exceptions will be specific table games and progressive jackpots. Yes, but not at the same time. Most casinos only let you have one promotional offer active at once. And you can only claim a welcome bonus once. Yes, free spins are frequently given out for a little as free at online casino sites. You can find some of these deals at the top of this article. Yes, but only as welcome bonuses. This is a generous way to kick off your gambling journey. You can receive more than 100 free spins on your welcome offer at Madslots and Luck Casino! Free spins can be used to win real cash, but you have to meet the wagering requirements before you’re allowed. You will also be limited by the max win. If your no-deposit free spins are a welcome bonus, you claim them by registering a new account. If it’s a log-in bonus, you just need to visit the website once a day. *Remaining Offer T&Cs Netbet T&Cs: New UK certified players | Valid mobile number required,No minimum deposit | 25 Starburst XXXtreme spins allocated | 40 times wagering on winnings | Ends 31.12.24 | £5 max bonus stake T&Cs apply 888 Casino T&Cs: New customers with a UK/Ireland registration address; re-registered ineligible.

"‘Talk dirty to me,’ I said – then my lover went quiet",Almara Abgarian,"Oct 25, 2024, 3:25pm","Oct 25, 2024, 3:26pm","Home,Lifestyle,Sex","‘I want you to talk dirty to me’. That was the honest answer to my lover’s question. We’d just finished having sex and were gearing up for round two when Lucas* surprised me by asking if there’s anything I particularly enjoy in bed. I’d known exactly which fantasy I wanted to try the moment he’d asked, but there’d been a brief pause while I decided whether or not to tell him the truth. Now that I had, he was silent. Panic began to set in as I wondered if I’d said something wrong. I worried my kink wasn’t to his liking and that I’d killed the mood completely by suggesting something too far out of his comfort zone. And while I was not, and am not, ashamed of my desires, I couldn’t deny that I felt awkward at that moment. For those who know me well, or certainly read my column regularly, this might sound surprising. Love reading juicy stories like this? Need some tips for how to spice things up in the bedroom? Sign up to The Hook-Up and we'll slide into your inbox every week with all the latest sex and dating stories from Metro. We can't wait for you to join us! On the surface I am a confident woman. I’m seen as the ‘big bad sex writer’, the one constantly suggesting that you try something new and the one you go to for answers about sexual dilemmas. Naturally, you wouldn’t think I have them myself. Yet as my situation with Lucas proves, I absolutely do. We all have our insecurities that creep up now and then and it turns out, telling my lover that I wanted him to talk dirty to me, was one of mine. A new survey released by the dating app Flure earlier this month – which, coincidentally, coincided with National Kink Month – revealed that 61% of people hide their sexual fantasies from their partners. I would imagine that, like me, many people worry about how their other half will react to their carnal pleasure of choice. And the kinkier the request, the more likely we are to stay quiet. Suppressing your desires could lead to boredom in the bedroom. So it was no surprise to me that, of those same participants, 53% said they felt ‘unfulfilled’ in their sex lives. That’s why, ultimately, I chose to share mine with Lucas. At this point in my life I like to think I am an expert at getting myself off. I’m not bragging, I promise, but I have had a lot of sex with a lot of people and I’ve taken the time to listen to my body when going solo too. So, to me, it is now simply a fact that the more you experiment, the more you get to know what brings you the most pleasure. For me, dirty talk is a big turn-on. I’ve never really considered why this gets my motor running but if I had to guess, I’d say it’s because it feels a little bit naughty. When I was younger, I used to read erotic novels. They were my first introduction to dirtier sex and each paragraph built the tension inside my body. Besides, I’m a writer – words are my life. And I also like a little bit of roleplay, which is easily incorporated with dirty talk. However, that doesn’t mean I am above feeling embarrassed about expressing my desires. When Lucas asked me the question, uttering the actual phrases at that moment felt weird somehow. For starters, the environment wasn’t quite right: It’s one thing to ask someone to call you filthy names after a few drinks at the pub or when the room is dark, but it was broad daylight and we were cuddling in bed. Secondly, I was more experienced than him. So, I hesitated. I felt shy. And when I did finally gather up the courage to share the specific words that turn me on, Lucas’s reaction left me feeling even more self-conscious. In reality, we couldn’t have sat in silence for more than a couple of seconds, but it felt like an eternity. Thankfully, when he next spoke, he revealed his own hesitation was more to do with him than me. The lesson here is that hiding your desire will not serve you or the person you’re having sex with He explained that, while he found the concept of dirty talk exciting, he felt out of his depth as he had never tried it before and worried about the execution. I felt happy that my lover was comfortable enough to share his feelings with me and relieved to know that his silence was more to do with him than my kink confession. Luckily, he was open to exploring this new side of himself with me and I respected that he needed to take it slow. So that’s just what we did. We took baby steps in the weeks that followed: starting with ‘lighter’ kinky phrases (‘take me, harder, just like that’) before working our way up to the dirtier stuff. Until, eventually, Lucas started dirty talking all on his own, completely unprompted – which I found incredibly thrilling. The lesson here is that hiding your desire will not serve you or the person you’re having sex with. You deserve the chance to live out your fantasy or – at the very least – talk about it openly, without judgement. And while it can be daunting to share more of yourself, it can also be the first step to a new amazing experience. Of course, it might not always work out. For example, a few years ago, another one of my lovers – Elijah* – told me that his fantasy was to try ejaculating on his partner’s face. My face. I didn’t think it would be my thing but I was still open to trying it. Ultimately, I was right. It was very messy and I couldn’t even open my eyes to see how much he enjoyed it (watching my partner’s pleasure is another turn-on of mine) as I was mostly worried about the sperm dripping onto the floor or getting an eye infection. While this kink wasn’t for me, I don’t regret the experience and I certainly didn’t shame Elijah for it. We all enjoy different things in the sack, some people like watching cooking shows while masturbating, others enjoy being called a slut while having sex, but my point is this… So long as you don’t harm yourself or anyone else, each and every desire is worthy. If you find that your kink doesn’t match that of your lovers’ and worry about how to proceed, well, you have three options: Compromise, try something else or find someone else to shag.

Be bold and be honest with your lover about one of your sexual fantasies, be it big or small. And then, ask them to share a kink of their own.
